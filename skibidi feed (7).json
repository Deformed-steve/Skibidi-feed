Up to four players can compete in the ten different events of a real-life decathlon, either in sequence or individually. Included are the 100-meter dash, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400-meter race, 110-meter hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw, and 1500-meter race. \n\nThe flat running events involve simple joystick waggling, which must be balanced with accurately-timed button presses to clear the hurdles - hitting them or breaking stride causes a loss of momentum and thus time. For jumping and throwing events, you must build momentum by waggling and then press the button to throw or jump at what you feel is the appropriate moment.\n\nFor each event, points are earned based on how well you do (this can be based on your running time, or how far you throw the javelin or discus, etc...), and the player with the most points at the end of the decathlon wins the gold medal.",

          "description": "CANYON BOMBER GAMES\n\nGAME 1: Canyon Bomber (One-Player)\nTest your skill against the computer.  It's not an easy task.  You've got six misses in which to match wits with the computer for a higher score.  Each time the bricks in the canyon are hit, the remaining bricks \"fall\" to a lower level (rather than remaining stationary in their original position).  Bricks that fall to a lower level are worth the points designated for that level.\n\nKeep an eye on the solid bar beneath your score on the upper right side of the screen.  It is a \"miss indicator\" and gradually decreases in length each time you miss until six misses are recorded and the game ends.  The bar is also color-coordinated with your planes and your score.\n\nSet your sights for 1000 points.  Although the game will not end if you reach the 1000 point mark, it's an excellent goal to set for yourself since it will be very difficult to obtain.\n\nGAME 2: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)\nThis game differs from Game 1 only in that you are competing against another player rather than the computer.  Play ends when six misses are recorded against both players.  the player with the highest score wins. \n\nDon't forget to keep an eye on your opponent's \"miss indicator\" as well as your own.  Bombs away!\n\nGAME 3: Canyon Bomber (One-Player)\nThis one's the same as Game 1 with one exception.  Rather than falling to a lower level, the bricks in the canyon stay \"suspended\" in their original position when the surrounding bricks are hit.\n\nGAME 4: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)\nYou compete with another player the same as in Game 2.  This time however, the brick remain suspended instead of falling to a lower level.\n\nGAME 5: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)\nGet set for a test of your endurance and concentration.  The first player to score 1000 points wins.  No time limit and no limit to the number of bombs or misses.  Falling, rather than suspended bricks are programed into this game.\n\nNo \"miss indicator\" will appear on the screen in games with unlimited bombs.\n\nGAME 6: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)\nThis game program is identical to Game 5, except that the bricks stay suspended.\n\n\nSEA BOMBER GAMES\n\nGAME 7: Sea Bomber (One-Player)\nYou're playing against the computer.  Set the level, release the bomb, and boom, you're ready for action.  Sounds easy, but the computer's a real steady competitor.  If you score 1000 points before the computer does, you're a winner!\n\nGAME 8: Sea Bomber (Two-Player)\nThis time you're competing against another player in a race to the 1000 point mark.",

Many desert creatures including vultures, warriors, flying fish, sphinxes and more will all attempt to stop you from succeeding in your task.

Your falcon isn't completely unarmed, and has the ability to fire darts which can be used to destroy the assorted enemies and the sphinx. In the sand, you will occasionally come across some hieroglyphs. Several different superpowers can be gained by landing and hopping over three of these hieroglyphs.

It's very tricky. So, please read these directions and give yourself some practice time. Then you can aim for the World Record.\n\nGame 1: Straight-ahead Dragster, one or two players.\nGame 2: Steerable Dragster, one or two players.\n\nYour Joystick Controller is both the clutch and gear shift for your Dragster; the red button is your gas pedal. Use left Joystick for the top car; right one for bottom car. Hold Joystick with button at the upper left.\n\nTo shift gears, clutch by pushing Joystick to the left and shift by letting the Joystick spring back to the center.\n\nYour car starts each race in neutral (N). There are four gear positions--1, 2, 3, 4--and you must clutch and shift between each gear. You cannot downshift.\n\nWhen the countdown reaches 0, you can start. If you drop into gear too soon, before the end of the countdown, EARLY will appear on the screen and you have to wait for the next race. You can clutch during the countdown, but you cannot drop into 1st until  the countdown reaches 0.\n\nThe object of Dragster is to beat your opponent across the screen, or to race against the clock for best time.",

E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces scattered around in order to regain energy which is constantly depleted with time. \n\nThe phone pieces are in some of the pits, and E.T. must jump in to get them; sometimes there's also a dead flower in the pit which provides extra points if brought back to life. Once E.T. has done his business in the pit, to get out he must levitate his way out, though he must watch out not to fall into the pit again after leaving. \n\nEvil scientists and agents wander around the area, trying to capture E.T. and steal the parts he's carrying.",

The first player to complete the Hangman Word scores one point and starts the next word. The first player to score five points wins the game.\n\nGAME 5:\nTwo players compete to complete the Hangman Word from a first through third grade vocabulary.\n\nGAME 6:\nTwo players test their word skill with Hangman Words from a first through sixth grade vocabulary.\n\nGAME 7:\nWords from a first through ninth grade vocabulary are used for competition between two players.\n\nGAME 8:\nTwo players compete using words from a first through high school vocabulary.\n\n\nGAME 9:\nNow it's your turn to choose the Hangman Word.

Both the player and the enemy bases are armed with laser blasters, which may fire a single continuous beam at a time. The player must destroy all three bases before they are able to target the saucer and fire their own laser blasts in defense. If the player's saucer is hit, it will lose altitude and crash to the ground; however, the player may direct this fall, potentially into one of the bases, destroying it as well. Each succeeding wave of enemy bases moves faster and targets the player's saucers more quickly, while the force field becomes stronger and decreases the amount of space in which the saucer can move.\nPlayers score points for each base destroyed, with points multiplying each wave up to a maximum of 90 points per base. Players earn extra flying saucers with each 1000 points scored and may keep a maximum of six extra saucers in reserve.\nPlayers who scored 100,000 points or more could submit photographic proof to Activision and be admitted to the Activision Federation of Laser Blasters.",

Each player controls a cop that starts on the left, and the first player to make it out the exit on the right wins. The game also includes of variety of options. The maze can be completely visible, completely invisible, or have just a few parts invisible. With invisible mazes you can optionally have the computer provide a sneak peak at the complete maze periodically. To make your task more challenging, one to five robbers may also be placed in the maze. If you are caught by one of the robbers, you will momentarily be stunned giving your opponent an advantage. You can also give your cop the ability to set up a blockade to confuse your opponent. This will look like a regular wall, however you can walk straight through it. The games speed can also be adjusted, from calculatingly slow to extremely fast.",

Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings.

Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This can be thrown to destroy an enemy. Mr. Do has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. From time to time an alpha monster will appear on the screen bearing one of the letters in EXTRA.

One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.\n\nMs. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.\n\nSurvive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of \"Junior\".",

First you must get through the meadow and across the ledges without losing life and limb.\n\nYou start in a screen called The Mysterious Meadow. You must hop from the top to the river, landing on the turtle while avoiding snakes and choppers that will lose you a life and butterflies that will send you back to start. Do not dally as you are timed and if time runs out, you lose a life. Once you get to the turtle, he will take you to The Land of Ledges. Here you must hop from ledge to ledge and change their color, ala Q*Bert. Beware of the man at the top of the screen, as he will drop stones that will lose you a life. In later levels, he will change some ledges back to their original color, forcing you to retrace your steps. You are still timed so don't delay. After you finish The Land of Ledges, it is off to The Bunny Bushes. This is just a cinematic of you finding a mate and family. You can skip this if you press fire.

          "description": "There are numerous enemy tanks crossing the countryside, destroying everything in their path! Your job is to command a robot tank to stop them. Robot Tank is a first person perspective arcade style action game. There are twelve squadrons of tanks to destroy, each containing twelve tanks. Each time you destroy a complete squadron, you earn an extra reserve tank before moving on to the next, more difficult squadron. The game takes place twenty four hours a day; gameplay will alternate from early morning to mid afternoon to late at night. In addition to the constantly changing time of day, the weather can also change unexpectedly. Snow, rain, and fog will appear occasionally making it tougher to spot your targets. Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites, such as speed, the radar, or your canons. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed; the game ends when all of your reserve tanks are gone.",

Your goal is to destroy all of the Zylon fighters you encounter, rescue cadets that are trapped on Zylon planets, and to find the planet Solaris to protect it from the Zylons. Your spaceship is equipped with a galactic map which can be used to warp to different sectors of the galaxy. The map shows the location of Zylon squadrons, Zylon planets, federation starbases, wormholes, clusters of stars, and Solaris when you find it. By warping to the correct sector, you can battle the numerous types of Zylon fighters to keep them from attacking federation bases and planets. Your spaceship has a limited amount of fuel; when you see the fuel gage get too low, you will need to warp to a federation starbase to refuel (make sure you leave enough fuel to warp). When flying over a Zylon controlled planet, you will see your cadets on the surface. If you rescue all of the cadets as you fly past, you will receive bonus points and an extra spaceship. The Zylon's have many different types of fighters which you will encounter, as well as some narrow corridors with blockades which you will need to clear in order to reach new locations in the galaxy.",

Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering.",

Before you get a chance at destroying NOMAD, you'll have to battle your way through ten levels (each consisting of multiple rounds). In each round you may encounter Klingon fighters, deadly anti-matter saucers, asteroid fields, and deadly meteors, all of which are capable of depleting the Enterprises energy. The game ends when your energy supply has completely run out. To fight these dangers, the Enterprise is equipped with an unlimited supply of phasers and a limited supply of photon torpedoes. Each round also contains one or more starbases; if you dock at a starbase, some of your supplies (such as energy and torpedoes) will be replenished. The game is played from two points of view; the top of the screen contains a third person view of the Enterprise (along with the ships gauges), and on the bottom of the screen is a first person point of view",

In a starbase sector, use your joystick to guide your reticle to the starbase when it is near you for repair and/or refueling. In a fight, you can take damage. If you see a L, it meas your lasers are out of commission. This mean you cannot fire (this is not good in a fight!). If you see a W, it means your warp drive is damaged. You will use twice as much fuel when warping. If you see an S, it means your shields are out. If you are hit again with no shields, you will be destroyed. If you see an R, it means your radar is damaged. You will not be able to see the enemies on the starmap until you get the radar fixed. All your starbases will still show with damaged radar except any that have been destroyed. When warping, if the screen at the bottom is green, you are headed to an empty sector. If it is red, you are headed to a sector with enemies in it. If it is blue, you are headed to a sector with a starbase in it. The game ends when either all the enemies are destroyed or you are destroyed.

You're required to shoot a specific number of aliens, then pass through a gate to the next stage. \n\nLike Defender, aliens come in all shapes and sizes, and have varying attack patterns. Some of them shoot at you, some bounce, but all the action is a far cry faster than Defender. Once all the aliens are destroyed, you must pass through an electro gate that zaps in certain patterns--failing this forces you to repeat the current level without scoring any points. After at least three Defender style screens, it's back to the dogfight. Subterranea awards extra lives not by scoring, but by completing stages without being hit. while Subterranea borrows concepts from other games and doesn't appear to be very original, there's just something about it that keeps you coming back for yet another game.",

          "description": "Super Cobra (スーパーコブラ Sūpā Kobura?) is a 1981 arcade game, the sequel to popular horizontally scrolling shooter Scramble, Super Cobra was developed by Konami and manufactured and distributed by Stern in North America. It is similar in concept to its predecessor, but much more difficult.\n\nThe game was a success, selling 12,337 video game arcade cabinets in the United States in four months, by October 2, 1981, becoming Stern's third best-selling arcade classic after Berzerk and Scramble. Scramble sold 15,136 cabinets in the US in five months earlier that year, adding up to 27,473 US cabinet sales for both.[1]\n\nSuper Cobra was widely ported by Parker Brothers, and there was an Adventure Vision handheld version from Entex.\n\nThe player controls a helicopter through tight caverns, and the slightest misstep will result in the loss of a life. However, unlike Scramble the game can be continued where the player left off by adding more credits.\n\nThe joystick accelerates, decelerates, moves up, and moves down. The helicopter uses a laser and bomb to destroy defenders, tanks, and UFO's while infiltrating 10 Super Cobra defense systems.[2]\n\nThe ship has a limited fuel supply, which is depleted over time. More fuel can be acquired by destroying fuel tanks in the game.[2]\n\nThe game is divided into ten sections, plus a finale, each with a different style of terrain and different obstacles. Players navigate through ten levels and a base, where they must safely make it through the level and remove the booty. The levels are described as follows,[2]\n\nPlayer must maneuver the chopper over mountainous terrain against fast and slow firing rockets.\nChopper faces Arcing missiles over a mountain terrain.\nSmart Bombs flying in groups of four over mountainous terrain. Rockets appear, but do not fire.\nSingle Smart Bombs over mountainous terrain. Again, Rockets appear, but do not fire.\nChopper flies through a cavern-like terrain against falling mines.\nRapidly firing, roving tanks over mountainous terrain. Rockets appear, but do not fire.\nManeuver through a field of meteors which explode when hit with bombs or 3 times with laser, plus a single, green, shadow meteor directly in front of chopper which explodes when hit five times with laser. Rockets appear but do not fire.\nChopper flies over mountainous terrain against rapidly firing UFOs. Tanks and rockets appear, but do not fire.\nChopper faces arcing missiles over tall buildings.\nFiring rockets in a building maze.\nBase: Player must maneuver the chopper over tall buildings against arcing missiles and rapidly firing tanks to reach the Booty and safely carry it away.\nThere is no intermission between each section; the game simply scrolls into the new terrain. If the player destroys the booty on the final level, they must start back at the beginning of the level.",

Though most of the gameplay focuses around dogfighting with enemy bogeys (dodging missiles). In addition to that, there are also night-flying missions that add difficulty due to limited vision.\n\nTaking off and landing however, also required additional skill as your doing it on the USS Enterprise (No relation to Star Trek), not on your standard airstrip. Pay attention to the F.D. officer as your preparing to take off (since he's the boss when it comes to this stuff...and try no to run over him...yet).\n\nYour weaponry consists of a M 61 Machine Gun and 3 different AIM Missiles (AIM 7, 9, 54) each packed with 15 missiles (that's a lot of missiles!).\n\nAfter each mission you will receive a Mission Rating which is based on your flying skill, number of bogey kill and number of weapons fired.",

The player's character is a small smiling face carrying a strand of dental floss above its head. The player must prevent the snack squares from reaching the row of white teeth along the bottom of the screen; repeated hits by the snacks cause the teeth to blink and disappear from tooth decay.\n\nOccasionally the Snack Attacker will dive from the top of the screen in an attempt to grab the player; the player loses a turn if the Snack Attacker succeeds. If teeth begin to decay, the player can press the joystick's fire button to call in the \"Tooth Protectors\": an orange toothbrush, green box of dental floss and purple dental rinse bottle move across the teeth, brushing, flossing and rinsing them.[",

You'll test your skill against competitors in distance and style events like ski jumping and hot dog skiing. You'll win by scoring the fastest time or by earning the most points. And the nation that wins the most events takes home the gold medal!",

Once the shield is down, you will need to use the Zorlon cannon to destroy the Qotile. The Zorlon cannon is located on the left side of the screen, and when fired can destroy the Qotile with a direct hit. The Qotile isn't completely unarmed against your attacks, however. Wandering around the screen is a destroyer missile, which will constantly be homing in on your Yar. This missile can not be destroyed, however you can temporarily hide from it in a shield which runs vertically in the center of the screen. The Yar will be unable to fire when hiding in the shield so you can't stay there indefinitely! The Qotiles second weapon is a swirl which it will randomly fire at you and should be dodged. When you finally destroy the Qotile you can move on to the next, faster round of gameplay. Several game variations are included which control the difficulty and speed of the game.",

But you have to be careful. If you hit an egg-carrying bird, it drops the egg and you have to act fast to catch it before it hits the ground and return it to a nest. At the same time, you have to watch for snakes that may be sneaking up to nests and gobbling eggs. If you can protect the eggs long enough, you can take them to another nesting site.",

Its obstacle-laden course is legendary among motorcycle maniacs.  Of course, nobody in their right mind would attempt this course.  The die-hard spectators remind you that fan is short for fanatic. They've staked out their favorite spots to view the races, and they are waiting for the roar of revving engines, the squeal of tires, the crunch of metal...\r\n\r\nIt's you against the clock and your bike is built for speed.  All you need to do is point it in the right direction and go for it!\r\n\r\nFour different tracks will separate the veterans from the rookies.  (Or the schizophrenics from the psychotics.)  Weekend amateurs will eat your dust, but you've got some pretty insane competition from your fellow, uh, pros.  Some of these guys look hungry for the sweet taste of victory, but some of them look hungry for the taste of raw meat!\r\n\r\nSo rev 'er up and let 'er rip!

          "description": "Tank Command is a vertically scrolling action game. You control a tank on a mission to capture the enemy flag as well as earn as many points as possible. To do this, you will need to blast your way through their defenses on three levels of increasing difficulty. Blocking your progress are enemy tanks, pillboxes, missiles, jeeps, infantry, huts, and more, all of which earn you points when destroyed. Your tank is equipped with a limited amount of fuel and ammo, however it can be replenished occasionally by collecting the bonus icons when they appear on the screen. If you can make it past all of the obstacles and capture the flag, then you win the game!\r\n\r\nThe 7800 is pretty much void of super-rare games like the 2600'?s Tooth Protectors and Chase the Chuckwagon, but don't worry, tracking down Tank Command in a box will cost you a pretty penny. As far as gameplay goes, Tank Command is not going to blow anyone away. Here you have a vertical scroller like Commando or Ikari Warriors minus the charm, quality level design, and reasonable difficulty. There are only three levels in the game, but just like its Froggo cousin Water Ski, the difficulty ramps so severely after the mindless first level that continuing takes strong will. The pink terrain is a bit odd, as well. Tank Command was only released in NTSC format.",

Each world is divided into different quadrants, and the player must pass through each quadrant before the time counter on the bottom of the game screen reaches zero. In each quadrant, the player can find pillar-like columns that house power-ups, objects that are beneficial or add extra abilities to the game character. At the end of each world's last quadrant is a serpent-like creature which must be defeated to advance. A status bar at the bottom of the screen displays the player's score, the time counter, the world number, the world quadrant, the number of bonus stars (items that increase the player's score count) collected by the player, and the number of lives, or continues, remaining.",

Mankind is recovering from hundreds of years of chaos and nuclear war, and civilization is being rebuilt by the Great King, who harnesses the power of the eight jewels. The jewels, known as the 8 Eyes, were formed at the centers of eight nuclear explosions that came close to destroying the Earth. The 8 Eyes have mysterious power which, in the wrong hands, could bring about the end of the world. The Great King's eight power-hungry dukes steal the jewels for themselves and banish the King to the nuclear wastelands, threatening to once again plunge the Earth into war.\n\nThe player controls Orin the Falconer and his fighting falcon Cutrus. His mission is to penetrate the Dukes' eight castles and retrieve the 8 Eyes. With the help of Cutrus, you must fight the Dukes' soldiers, nuclear mutants, and the duke of each castle to retrieve the jewels. After the jewels have been recovered, you must return them to the Altar of Peace so that the Great King may return and finish rebuilding the Earth.",

In this form, you are larger in size, can jump further, and have increased strength. You start the transformation with an amount of mega points; each time a creature injures you, points are lost.

However, a black limousine that escorts the player from the air force base to the final casino is portrayed as driving on grass. This is in direct opposition to the real New York City where the majority of the surface is concrete (either as roads, parking lots, or as foundations for the buildings). Only parks and some older residential districts use grass in their design in the real world. Buildings are either shown as dilapidated tenements, shiny towers, or as flashy casinos.\nAn English language translation was made in 2007 by a ROM hacker who goes by the nickname of \"Pale Dim.\" Using the game's upper case letters that resemble the Joystix font, the English translation allows players in English-speaking countries to better understand the game. One of the changes made was to change the explosion sound from the Japanese Bom to the English Boom.",

          "description": "Arctic is an action puzzle game that describes itself as \"active rail playing\". Each of more than two-dozen stages consists of a set of rails in various arrangements, often looping around each other and splitting in various directions. Each stage contains a number of colored balls which begin in corresponding slots, and after launching them the goal is to return the balls to the matching-colored slots. The only interaction the player has with the board is switching two sets of splits; there are yellow and blue splits, which will redirect any balls moving through them, and the player can only turn all of one color as a group. Many stages also contain bumpers and gates which will affect the speed and direction of the balls. Completing a puzzle often requires strategic use of the stage's features to bounce balls onto the correct paths.",

          "description": "Battle Wings, known in Japan either as B-Wing, is a vertically scrolling shooter first released as an arcade game by Data East in 1984. The game was ported by Data East to the Family Computer in 1986, and was Data East's very first home release for this platform.\n\nThe game consists of 45 levels (30 in the Family Computer version), and no background story or plot is given. The player controls a ship called the FX-1, and collects power-up parts (called a \"wing\") to progress through the levels and ultimately defeat the Gobunasu armored mobile fortress in the final level. The game consists of two different top-view screen levels, where the player can press the second button to descend to the ground whenever they do not have a power-up. The player is unaffected by attacks from airborne units while they are playing on the ground level, but the ship is automatically brought back into the air after a certain period of time. The player can still be hit by attacks from ground units while they are on the ground level, and can also lose their ship by crashing into obstacles. The 8-way joystick controls the player's movements, and one button is used for shooting, and the other is used for descending to the ground (or un-equipping wings). The background image continues infinitely when the player scrolls in the horizontal directions.\n\nCompleting the final level of the game causes the score counter to increase to 9,999,999 points, which the player can enter as their high score. The player can also score cheap points by equipping and un-equipping their power-up. Pressing the button twice while the un-equipping animation is occurring cause the player to gain 2,000 points. The player gains an extra life every 40,000 points, so it is possible to gain lives almost infinitely. If the player gains over 10,000,000 points in this way before completing the final level, the counter takes over 20 minutes to increase to 99,999,999 points.",

If the photograph fades fully, Marty would lose a life as it would show him vanishing. Collecting 100 clocks restored the photograph to its full, unfaded status. Two power-ups can help improve Marty's control: bowling balls that can destroy enemies and a skateboard which can speed up gameplay. There are also three minigames at the end of each stage, featuring such scenarios as Marty repelling Biff Tannen's gang of bullies from a cafe, blocking all the kisses Lorraine sends Marty (in the shape of little hearts), and having to position his guitar properly to stay in tune at the dance in order for George and Lorraine to kiss. The gameplay on these stages is often compared to that of Paperboy.",

Over the next three decades, young Biff uses the information to win money on the outcome of each sporting event he bets on, making him the richest and most powerful man in the world by 1985A. To ensure that no one else gets their hands on the almanac, Biff travels through time and collects various items and puts them behind locked doors in three different periods. This action has caused a disruption in time, and now the Space Time Continuum is falling apart.

You'll also have to contend with some of Mother Nature's hazards like changing wind conditions and Pebble Beach's most difficult obstacle - the ocean.\n\nOnce you tee off you'll have all kinds of decisions to make. Check your score card to see how you're doing. The card tells you the distance in yards and par for each hole. The computer gives you a bird's-eye view and cross-sectional view of each hole, as well as close-ups of the green. You select the right club for each shot. Control your shot to get the power, distance, and hook or slice you want on the ball. After you've made your shot the computer tells you what kind of lie you have as well as the remaining distance to the hole.",

          "description": "Baseball Stars 2 is a 2-player baseball arcade game released by SNK in 1992 for the Neo-Geo console.  A less cartoony console version was released for the NES by Romstar the same year.  Baseball Stars 2 for the Nintendo Entertainment System was distributed by Romstar in 1992.  Changes made from the original Baseball Stars, released by SNK in 1989: Female players are no longer included in any form.  Two additional batting stances. These additional stances are never used for players on custom teams. They will only appear on the pre-made teams' players.  Enhanced pitch control.  Ability to shift field formations when playing defense.  Ability to view your team roster and ratings while in-game.  Sidearm-style pitchers are never generated on custom teams. They can only be hired.  Easier bunting controls; bunts are now retractable. (Hold Down+A to bunt instead of stopping the swing partway through.)  Ability to see lead-offs while pitching/batting.  Six pitchers and four bench players instead of five each.  New music and home run animations. These include the \"Power connect\" graphic for a two-run home run, an animated graphic of the batter rounding the bases and pumping his fist for a 3-run home run or grand slam, and a similar (yet very rare) graphic including a Yorkshire terrier following the batter for a come-from-behind (usually game-ending) home run in a dramatic situation.  Can no longer name custom teams or rename players on custom teams.  You can still upgrade player using the same 15-point system introduced in the original Baseball Stars. However, the random points you get to disperse to various skills each time you purchase a player upgrade changed from between 1 and 6 to between 1 and 5.  Player upgrades overall are much more expensive while the money received during play has remained about the same. This makes it much more time-consuming to upgrade players to maximum.  You can still fire players and hire players. However, due to the fact you cannot change the names of hired players your hired player will always be named generic names given by the game (examples 'STAR 5', 'ROOK 2', etc.). This can also lead to multiple players sharing the same name throughout the custom teams, even conceivably multiple players on the same team with the same name.  Players can still create leagues of up to 125 games (6 teams playing each other 25 times) and view statistics such as League Standings and Top 10 in Average, Home Runs, Runs Batted In, Earned Run Average, Wins and Saves. (A peculiar glitch occurs when viewing league leaders. The last pitcher listed on any user-created team in \"View Team\" does not appear in any of the Top 10 leaderboards.)",

It is a port of the arcade game Tank Battalion with additional features (including two player simultaneous play, and an edit feature, both explained later). There was also a rendition for Nintendo's Vs. System arcade cabinets.\nThe player, controlling a tank, must destroy enemy tanks in each level, which enter the playfield from the top of the screen. The enemy tanks attempt to destroy the player's base (represented on the map as a bird, eagle or Phoenix), as well as the human tank itself. A level is completed when the player destroys all 20 enemy Tanks, but the game ends if the player's base is destroyed or the player loses all available lives.",

The player controls a cave man character who has had all his bones stolen from a prehistoric bank by a dinosaur.  Bignose sets off on an adventure through numerous prehistoric settings.  Bignose defeats enemies using a club, however he also has access to a primitive skate board device (stone-boarding), via his invention - the wheel. The game is essentially a platform game in which the player collects bones and other items, while travelling from left to right until reaching the goal.  B.N.F.O also had a two player mode and the addition of numerous secret levels and bonuses.  Big Nose Freaks Out has become popular as more people have access to the ROM file through emulation websites.",

It is also very long with four islands (Paradise Island, Monster Island, Terror Island, and Chaos Island) each containing several levels. Big Nose the Caveman dies in a single hit unless he has stones. The stones can shoot out of his club, killing enemies. As many as three stones can come out of the club.

The game was advertised by the legendary monster truck of the same name in the cartoon segment of the 1990 television show Video Power, titled The Power Team.  The show also often used sound effects for the actions of not only Bigfoot, but others as well.  The gameplay involves racing monster trucks including the title truck, Bigfoot (blue). The computer controlled trucks are green (The Growler) and yellow (The Charger) if the computer's truck runs out of money and cannot repair their rig.  It was not uncommon for a skilled player to be challenged by three to four different monster trucks during the game.  In two player mode the 2nd player's truck is red.  The object of the game is to advance to the next level (race) with incurring the least amount of damage as possible.  The levels consist of car crushing, mud bog, tractor pull, hill climb and the later levels are a combination of everything except the sled pull, simply called a drag race.  To advance to the next event the player must complete a \"cross country\" race collecting money, points, etc. without damaging the truck.",

After being humiliated once again by his rival, Jeff \"Crash\" Cooney and his blue-collar buddies from Southside High School at the All-City Track Meet, he has decided to issue a challenge to Crash. Inviting two of the other elite high schools to participate in the challenge, plus an additional team sponsored by his wealthy father, Todd has seemingly stacked the deck against Crash and his boys. The game has four different teams to choose from, as well as a fifth computer-controlled team. Each team have five members each with their own strengths and weaknesses, making some better suited to certain events than others. Before each event, players have the opportunity to go shopping in the mall to buy power-ups for their characters. These items are paid for through the various medals that each team achieve as they progress through the challenge, but since the winner of the challenge is the team that collects the most medals overall, players must be fairly judicious in how much they spend. There are two types of events in the game: individual events (Hammer Throw and Roof Top Jumping) and head-to-head events (400 Meter Hurdles, Swimming and Fighting). In individual events, each team takes turn individually and ranking is determined by who gets the most points. The head-to-head events take place under a single elimination tournament format, in which one player against another in a series of heats. The player who successfully defeats both of his opponents will get to compete against a member of Team Thornley for first place. The game can be played by up to four players. Since there's never more than two teams competing at the same time, the third and fourth player can play simply by alternating between the two controllers. Thus, a four player adapter is not required, unlike other Kunio-kun games.",

The game's plot is not an adaptation of the movie, but rather serves as an original continuation to the film's events.  The story begins when Rufus summons Bill S. Preston Esq. and \"Ted\" Theodore Logan for a mission.  Both boys arrive at different times; first Ted then Bill.  They are informed that time-space rebels have gone back in time, kidnapping various historical figures and leaving them stranded in different time periods.  So now they must travel to the time periods, retrieve these figures and return them to their correct time periods.  This must be done as soon as possible; for if history isn't made right, the boys will miss the big concert that will launch Wyld Stallyns' music career.  Unfortunately, Rufus can only loan out a pay phonebooth for this trip.  Once the mission is explained, Ted leaves and Bill arrives later.  Rufus states that since they both came alone, it's best that they work separately.  From there Bill is brought up to speed on the situation.  Bill is instructed to go back in time and leave items to help Ted along the way in each time period he visits.  When Bill has done this he will start his own search.  Ted will also do the same for Bill's search after he has found a historical figure.",

          "description": "Bill Elliott's NASCAR Challenge is a simulation of the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit, and thus operates like a racing game.  The gameplay action was always through an in-car perspective.  Players could chose to run single races at each track or run for the season championship.  The race distance was chosen by the player, which ranged from 10 miles to the realistic distance of 500 miles for the superspeedway races.  In the MS-DOS version, the championship consisted of a visit to each of the eight tracks.  In the NES and Game Boy versions, the season championship consisted of each of the four tracks run twice, for a total of eight races.  Championship points were awarded consistent to the real-life Winston Cup of the time.  Both the MS-DOS and Nintendo versions allowed the player to setup the car, with effects to be seen.  Both of those versions also allowed the player to choose whether they would race with the effect of damage on their car or not.  However, a large enough collision with another racecar on the track always would result in the player going out of the race in an out-of-control crash.",

          "description": "Binary Land is a puzzle video game developed by Hudson Soft in 1983 for the MSX, FM-7, NEC PC-6001, NEC PC-8801, and in 1985 for the Famicom. The MSX version saw release in Japan by Kuma Computers Ltd in 1984.\n\nWhile the Famicom version has a grand total of 99 levels; there is no ending screen implemented in the game.\n\nIn the Famicom version of the game, players have to unite two penguins, Gurin (male) and Malon (female), who are in love. The MSX version features a human boy and a human girl; gameplay remains identical to the Famicom version. Players control Malon and Gurin simultaneously; with a timer adding to the difficulty. These penguins move in mirror images of each other. The game features many different stages. After completing the 17th stage, players have to start over again on stage 1. \"Je te veux\" by Erik Satie is the background music in the game during the levels. Upon uniting the two penguins, Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\" is played.\n\nA top-down view is utilized in the game; similar to the method used in The Adventures of Lolo. Standing in their way are spiders, birds and other creatures which the player must attack with the penguins' spray. Cobwebs occupy some of the cells on the playing field; possibly slowing the player down long enough for a spider to kill either Gurin or Malon. With each level arranged on a 10-by-15 grid and a vertical wall separating the two penguins from each other, only the upper central cell is free for both characters to reach. This \"free cell\" always holds the caged heart that is required to complete the level. A row of walls surrounding each player in a maze-like environment. In order to make the challenges more difficult; they are unbalanced and offer a different experience for Gurin and Malon.",

          "description": "Shadow of the Ninja can be played by up to two players simultaneously, with one player controlling Hayate (the male ninja) and the other as Kaede (the female ninja). In either mode, the player can decide which character they want to control before the game actually begins. There are no actual performance differences between either character.\nThe player character can run, crouch, climb ladders, attack, and jump like in most side-scrolling action games as well as hang onto an overhang and move under it. If the player has more than half of their vitality remaining, they can perform a special attack by holding a button for an extended period, summononing a thunderstorm that will damage all on-screen enemies, but at the cost of roughly half of their maximum vitality.\nThe player's default weapon is a katana, which can be traded for a kusarigama and vice-versa. The kusarigama has a longer range than the katana and can be swung upwards diagonally and horizontally. However, the kusarigama can only damage enemies from a specific distance and does not work as well at close range like the katana. If the player picks up a weapon they already have, its attack power will be strengthen by an increment of one level (with up to three attack levels). However, if the player takes too much damage, their weapon's strength will be reduced back to its previous level. There is also the possibility to use both weapons, if the player starts with the kusarigama and collects secret powerups hidden in some levels (for example in the central wheel of level 1.3). The player can also obtain shurikens and hand grenades as well, both which can only be used as long the player's supply lasts before the player reverts back to using the katana or kusarigama. All four weapons are obtained by destroying item boxes scattered throughout each stage, along with vitality potions. Something worth mentioning is the fact that the potions being offered in order to heal yourself if played by 2 players will have different colors, which depending if the color of the potion is the same as the character that use it, it will replenish a large amount of health but if the color of the potion is not the same it will heal less.\nThe game consists of five stages, with the first four stages being divided into three segments and the final stage into two. The player will fight numerous types of enemy characters throughout each stage, including bosses and sub-bosses. once a boss has been defeated it will explode, this explosion will heal players the closer they are from it, since actually the same amount of health from one stage will be carried to the next one until either recovered with potions or by dying. The game ends if the player loses all of their vitality and only five chances are provided to continue. If two players are playing the game, their continues will be shared.",

          "description": "It is based on Bo Jackson's baseball career.  An option allows the player to play anywhere from five to nine innings.  Nintendo Power gave this game a 2.8 out of 5 in their September 1991 review while Electronic Gaming Monthly issued a 4.25 out of 10 review in their October 1991 issue of their magazine.  Players can either play in exhibition mode or playoff mode. Either one or two players can participate.  In addition to those options, a CPU vs CPU mode and a CPU vs CPU quick mode are available in order to quicken up a tournament; the purpose is to see the stats of that particular match and quickly end tournaments.  The game uses city names but not the team names because of not having any proper licensing with Major League Baseball.  However, the players are purely fictional and they cannot be edited.  Some of the player names are parodies of real life baseball players (such as Baltimore's \"Kenrip\" being a not-so-subtle parody of Cal Ripken).  There is even a cheat code that allows players to play as an all-Bo Jackson baseball team.",

          "description": "The game's protagonist is Bonk, a strong caveboy who battles anthropomorphic dinosaurs and other prehistoric themed enemies.  Bonk's mission is to rescue Princess Za (a small pink Pleisiosaur-type reptile) who has been kidnapped by the evil King Drool (a large, green Tyrannosaurus-type dinosaur).  In the Arcade version, Bonk is also assisted by a female version of himself.  Bonk attacks enemies by \"bonking\" them with his large, invincible forehead.  Bonk starts the game with three hearts' worth of health, which are depleted to blue as Bonk takes damage and three extra lives.  Bonk's health can be restored in increments by collecting fruits and vegetables.  Bonk can also collect pieces of meat as power-ups; these lend him special abilities and make him stronger.  There are three stages of power-up: his normal self, a second stage during which he can stun enemies by pounding on the ground and a third stage where he becomes temporarily invulnerable.  Meat can be found in two varieties: big meat and small meat.  The effects of meat are additive but wear off over time.  A small meat gives Bonk the second stage of meat power but will eventually decay into the first stage of meat power, and then back into regular Bonk.  Eating a small meat while in stage two will put Bonk into the third, invincible stage of meat power.  And eating either size of meat while in the third stage of meat power-up will reset the timer on Bonk's meat power.  Bonk can occasionally collect red heart power-ups that refill an entire heart worth of health, or even more rarely, a large red heart which restores all of Bonk's missing health.  There are also two rare, blue heart power-ups in the game which will increase Bonk's maximum health by one heart.  Bonking an enemy will typically knock it backward and slightly into the air.  Defeating an enemy yields points and also releases a small \"smiley\" power-up.  Bonk's smileys are totaled at the end of each stage after defeating the boss of that stage.  The player is given additional points and a caveman type congratulation based on how many smileys were collected.",

The player can move along platforms, as well as jump to those above and to the side, similar to most platform games.\nThe player can also blow bubbles. These can trap enemies, who are defeated if the bubble is then burst by the player's spiny back. Bubbles that contain enemies can be popped at the same time resulting in different foods being projected throughout the level. Each enemy trapped in a bubble equates to a different food. Food is consumed and transferred to points (an increasing scale of 1000 points is awarded for each enemy burst in tandem with another meaning: one enemy burst equals one food item worth 1000 points, two enemies burst equals two food items worth 1000 and 2000 points, three enemies burst equals three food items worth 1000, 2000, and 3000 points, and so on) which results in more lives. These same bubbles also float for a time before bursting, and can be jumped on, allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas. Players progress to the next level once all enemies on the current level are defeated.\nEnemies turn \"angry\"  becoming pink-colored and moving faster  if they are the last enemy remaining, escape from a bubble after being left too long, or a certain amount of time has been spent on the current level. A monster will also become angry if either player collects a skull (the only negative item in the game), and the monster is hit by the resulting comet crossing the screen. However, this is a rare occurrence.\nAfter a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These do not need to be defeated to complete the level, and disappear once a player's life is lost.\nContact with enemies and their projectiles (rocks, lasers, fireballs, etc.) is deadly, resulting in the loss of a life.\nThe game's music was written by Japanese team Zuntata.

          "description": "The player assumes the role of an unnamed commando trying to destroy several enemy military bases. The player's character is seen from behind and initially starts behind a protective wall (the wall can get damaged and shattered by enemy fire). The player must use a limitless ammunition gun and a limited number of grenades to fend off enemy troops and damage the base. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen depletes as foes are destroyed and certain structures (usually the ones that collapse when destroyed, rather than simply shattering) are brought down. At the successful completion of a level by fully depleting the enemy gauge, all the remaining buildings onscreen collapse and the player progresses to the next stage. Boss fights, however, start from the beginning if a player dies. (A feature criticised by many players. It can be circumvented, however, if two players play simultaneously and at least one stays alive at a given moment.)\nPower-ups appear from time to time, being released from objects destroyed onscreen. Some power-ups give special weapons: One of them is an extremely fast machinegun and other one is an automatic shotgun with a slightly lower firing rate, but has a larger crosshair, allowing it to strike a wider area with each shot. Others grant extra grenades or additional points.\nTwo players could play this game, cooperatively, simultaneously.\nThe arcade cabinet is a standard upright. Each player uses a trackball to move the player from side to side, and move the crosshairs about the screen. On later board revisions, a joystick was installed instead with an optional sub-pcb for use with a trackball. With a trackball, rolling (an invincible movement during which the player could not attack) is done by pushing the trackball to maximum speed.",

The player walk, jump, climb on vines, moonwalk (by pressing the \"select\" button) and shoot an unlimited supply of grape jelly beans as projectiles. As was the case with other Capcom games, such as Mega Man and DuckTales, one can play the first four levels in any order that you want, but the final level is only available after you have collected the musical notes from each of the four levels.\nThe first four levels include The Grape Vine, The Factory, The Maize Maze and The Juicery. The final level takes places in The Clouds. During each level you can collect 'I' icons that give you temporary invincibility, regular black musical notes for bonus points, 'Sunshine' icons to restore your health, and 'Raisinette' icons to give an extra life to the player. One can also locate items by shooting at the thin air or at columns.",

These bases are designed to drain Earth's energy and feed it to their mother space station. If the space station is allowed to obtain enough energy, it will destroy the Earth with a massive laser blast. The player must destroy the enemy bases, then go after the space station itself. Scientists, during the course of the game, are working on a top-secret Neutron Cannon. During several missions, the player must make supply drops to the scientists working underground. Sometimes, the aliens will have a scientist captive. Then the player must defeat the alien base and take the scientist to safety.",

For centuries he dwelled within the plasma of energies of the stones where the Runes were hidden.  Until at last it drove him insane.  Such was the power of the stone that even the bitter hallucinations of his madness were given life.  Six deadly beings appeared stealing the Rune Stones.

Well think again, 'cause according to a damsel in distress, evil Count Dracula has left a horrifying curse in his wake. And the only hope you have of ending the terror is to destroy his missing body parts! Talk about your frightening quest, searching a maze of mansions, graveyards and dark, eerie forests - each guarded by man-eating werewolves, fire-throwing zombies and other devilish demons. Your grim chances are kept alive in Transylvania, where cowardly villagers offer clues to the whereabouts of Dracula's remains. And where you'll purchase magic weapons, including silver knives and flame whips. But beware the night. For when the sun disappears, Dracula's curse grows deadlier. And your chances grow dimmer and dimmer.",

          "description": "Saint Seiya: Ougon Densetsu is an RPG based around the anime and manga series known as Saint Seiya. It was developed and published by Bandai in 1987 for the Famicom.\n\nThe story of the game draws heavily from the first story arc of the series, from the beginning of the story to the fight with the Gold Saints. The game remains faithful to the original story while introducing some original elements. When the game came out, the story line was in the middle of the Gold Saints story arc. As a result, the last boss of the game is an original character. The actual final fight of the Gold Saints arc was carried over into this game's sequel, Saint Seiya: Ougon Densetsu Kanketsu Hen.\n\nThe gameplay mixes side scrolling action scenes to transport the character from place to place where he may have to jump over obstacles and fight basic enemies, with a turn based combat system against bosses and other significant battles. In order to be successful at these turn based battles, the player must distribute his power, or Cosmos, to various attributes before each attack. Failure to do so typically results in no damage dealt to the opponent, and a lot of damage received. When Life is lost, the main character can be revived, but if all Cosmos is lost, then the game is over.",

To prove that she has visited a particular location, she must drive around the location painting every section of the road white. However, the police, who have no tolerance for vandalism, attempt to stop the driver from completing her goal. The player's car can jump and fire cans of oil. To avoid forcing the player from retracing the same roads again, the roads change color when the car drives over them, indicating that that specific road has been painted. There are three main obstacles: police, cats and spikes. The police chase after the car and if a police car comes into contact with the main character's car, the car \"explodes\" by turning into a group of hearts and the player loses a life. To combat this, the player can obtain cans of oil, which can be used to cause the police cars to spin out of control, allowing the player to bump them off the screen. Other enemies include a cat, which, when hit, causes the player to lose an extra life as the cat goes diagonally off the screen (but does not cause the car to \"explode\") with playing of a comical music, \"Der Flohwalzer\", known as \"Neko Funjatta\" (I Stepped on the Cat) in Japan. There is also spikes, which make the car \"explode\" on contact. Occasionally, a balloon may float by during any given stage. If the car touches one of these balloons, it collects it and collecting three such balloons will activate a warp that sends the car multiple stages ahead and provides significant bonus points. Although the city you travel to will change, the difficulty pattern of the road will remain the same. As the number of cities you travel to loop endlessly, the game is not shortened by taking a warp. One particular thing about this game is the \"catchy\" tune that plays in the background as you enter a new city.

          "description": "Cocoron is a side scrolling platform game developed by Takeru. Tapir, an enigmatic blue wizard in spotted pajamas from the Dream World, sends the player on a quest to rescue princess Rua. But things quickly become more complicated and the player soon has to rescue other characters along the way, such as Santa Claus, the king of Trump castle and the blue fairy Cocoron. Tapir can manipulate people's dreams and this ability gives Cocoron an unique twist - the player can assemble his own character by combining one of the eight available heads to one of the eight available bodies (which both include several designs to choose from, resulting in literally hundreds of combinations! ). More than a mere physical appearance, each part also defines the character's attributes, such as his health, speed, how high he can jump and so forth. As a rule of thumb, heavier characters are slower than light ones, but have more health and resistance. There is also a list of eight different weapons to choose from (from boomerang to shurikens, umbrellas and music notes). They all come with different attack patterns and strength - some shoot straight whereas others fire along an arc or explode on contact. They can also be powered up, and collecting five power icons (symbolized by the weapon in use) upgrades the weapon to the next level (up to a maximum of five times). Colored eggs are scattered around each stage or left behind by defeated enemies - cracking them open release all kind of items, such as health, extra lives, weapon power-ups and colored orbs. The latter trigger special events - some power up the active weapon for a short amount of time, whereas others allow the player to control slides, grant him invincibility or refill his health bar. Cocoron features a world map and is divided into five different areas - the player is free to play them in any order and, interestingly, stages change in function of the sections he travels through. Finally, up to six different characters can be created and stored, and returning to the house at the center of the map allows to switch between them.  --VideoGameDen.com",

The zones are Cubic Zone, Mirror Zone, Tube Zone and Final Zone. This game differs from the original Breakout as it contained enemies on screen that could be hit to gain power ups. Powerups included a parachute to slow the ball down, multiple balls, or projectiles. There were also level warps in the form of \"Konami Man\", who would fly from top to bottom of the play area. There were typically 1 - 3 enemies on screen at once, appearing out of a trapdoor in the top corners, or let in through the side walls. Every few levels there was also a boss, ranging from a small dragon to a centipede. The bosses changed colour from Green to Blue to Pink, each time increasing in speed. Each level also contained a hidden letter which made up a password presented at the end of the game (Zone 4 Level 11). If this was not input correctly, the player restarted the game from the beginning. If the player input the password correctly, they were shown the end credits which consisted of a procession of the enemies from the game. The password is MERRYCHRISTMAS.",

          "description": "Crackout is a video game that was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Konami in 1991. It is based upon Atari's Breakout games of the 1970s. The object of the game is to clear levels by either destroying all bricks or defeating the enemies.\nThere are four zones of eleven levels each. The zones are Cubic Zone, Mirror Zone, Tube Zone and Final Zone. This game differs from the original Breakout as it contained enemies on screen that could be hit to gain power ups. Powerups included a parachute to slow the ball down, multiple balls, or projectiles. There were also level warps in the form of \"Konami Man\", who would fly from top to bottom of the play area. There were typically 1 - 3 enemies on screen at once, appearing out of a trapdoor in the top corners, or let in through the side walls. Every few levels there was also a boss, ranging from a small dragon to a centipede. The bosses changed colour from Green to Blue to Pink, each time increasing in speed. Each level also contained a hidden letter which made up a password presented at the end of the game (Zone 4 Level 11). If this was not input correctly, the player restarted the game from the beginning. If the player input the password correctly, they were shown the end credits which consisted of a procession of the enemies from the game. The password is MERRYCHRISTMAS.",

          "description": "Theodore \"Todd\" Thornley IV has had enough. After being humiliated once again by his rival, Jeff \"Crash\" Cooney and his blue-collar buddies from Southside High School at the All-City Track Meet, he has decided to issue a challenge to Crash. Inviting two of the other elite high schools to participate in the challenge, plus an additional team sponsored by his wealthy father, Todd has seemingly stacked the deck against Crash and his boys. The game has four different teams to choose from, as well as a fifth computer-controlled team. Each team have five members each with their own strengths and weaknesses, making some better suited to certain events than others. Before each event, players have the opportunity to go shopping in the mall to buy power-ups for their characters. These items are paid for through the various medals that each team achieve as they progress through the challenge, but since the winner of the challenge is the team that collects the most medals overall, players must be fairly judicious in how much they spend. There are two types of events in the game: individual events (Hammer Throw and Roof Top Jumping) and head-to-head events (400 Meter Hurdles, Swimming and Fighting). In individual events, each team takes turn individually and ranking is determined by who gets the most points. The head-to-head events take place under a single elimination tournament format, in which one player against another in a series of heats. The player who successfully defeats both of his opponents will get to compete against a member of Team Thornley for first place. The game can be played by up to four players. Since there's never more than two teams competing at the same time, the third and fourth player can play simply by alternating between the two controllers. Thus, a four player adapter is not required, unlike other Kunio-kun games.",

          "description": "Cyberball is an Atari Games arcade game of 7-man American football, using robotic avatars of different speeds, sizes, and skill sets. The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from \"cool\" to \"warm\", \"hot\", and \"critical\" status as it is used. Players can only defuse the ball, resetting it from its current state back to \"cool\" by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession, whether through touchdown, interception or fumble. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball. Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play. Players select from run, pass or option plays on offense, after which the computer presents four individual plays from which to choose. On defense, a player can select short, medium or long defenses, and then select a specific defensive scheme.\nThe standard Cyberball cabinet consists of two monitors, each with two sets of controls for a maximum of four players, but Atari Games released single player and two player versions as well.\nThe standard configuration allows single player, two player cooperative, two player head-to-head or four player head-to-head play. Playing with two teams of two persons opened up a new dimension of gameplay. Computer controlled avatars ran offensive patterns in very specific ways before reaching their assigned passing spots. Human players, however, could exploit the fact that a number of offensive plays started with identical formations. By choosing one play, but moving their avatars in imitation of a similar but different play, the offensive team could disguise their intentions before suddenly breaking for their assigned pass locations. This offensive flexibility forced defending players to quickly recognize plays and move to break them up by rushing to what they guessed was the intended passing spot. Most often, the timely use of the defender's turbo, a short-term speed boost usable once per play, would determine whether the play resulted in a missed pass, an interception, a long gain, or a score. This ability to improvise in four player mode built the popularity of Cyberball, leading to many tournaments across the United States for a period of time.\nCyberball was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 by Jaleco. Tengen intended to release it unlicensed, but Jaleco purchased rights to publish it first. It has also been ported to numerous other platforms, including the Commodore Amiga, Atari Lynx and Sega Genesis.",

To succeed the player must press the pads with there feet and hands at the same time as the on screen aerobics instructor. Any missed movements are recorded on a mistake counter and 10 missed movements will fail the level. The routines (a set of repeated movements) start slow and simple with a bit of no-penalty practise time however as the player gets better the routines get more complex with less practices time. Each level has a set number of routines that increase with each level from 4 at the start to a total of 32 on the final level (level 7). At the successful completion of each level the player will get a pass stamp which they can enter later to skip that level.",

In-between levels, Darkman must photograph his quarry before he can make a mask of them. These scenes involve moving the cursor to take a picture of the gangster.

          "description": "Dash Galaxy in the Alien Asylum was an action game for the Nintendo Entertainment System released in 1990 exclusively in North America. Players take the role of Dash Galaxy, a space scout who has been captured by a hostile civilization. Gameplay involves a series of floors with several rooms each. Keys must be collected to progress to higher floors and, eventually, an escape ship. Dash's only weapons are a limited supply of bombs and remote detonators. Good timing is crucial to completing the game, requiring navigation of trampoline jumps and roaming enemies. While the rooms are side-scrolling action puzzles, the floors have a  overhead view and include more difficult block-moving puzzles which can fatally trap a player.",

Each race consists of capturing a flag and finding the exit door, all while squishing or gunning down as many people on foot as possible while avoiding helicopters and heat seeking missiles that are actively trying to discourage this unique hobby. If the time runs out, a barrage of missiles descends on the player's car to indicate that the race is over.\n\nThe player has a certain amount of money to begin with and earns more money for completing the races alive.

Each scenario gives a different set number of units to use, which the player can mix and match between the different typese without going over that limit. When in a one-player game, the second controller can be used to modify the CPU forces. When playing against the CPU, the computer will be given a different ratio of units to command than the player. On the easiest scenario both the player and the CPU have the same amount of units, on all others the CPU will have more than the player. There is no variance in artificial intelligence, so the only thing that makes the later maps harder is the larger number of units the CPU has. The game is turn-based with no time limit. The object of the game is to destroy the enemy's headquarters unit. The player that does so first wins. Units have different mobility range, which varies according to the unit type and (except for aircraft) the terrain. They also have different shooting range, though this is fixed and not depends of the terrain. All unit types have limited ammunition and fuel. In order to replenish them the player must land them at the appropiate buildings; for example, all aircraft must stop at an airport in order to recharge their fuel and ammo supply. A certain unit is particularly strong or weak against a particular opponent, performing average against every other unit types.",

This is his primary weapon while the torpedoes become his second weapon. After the player has destroyed every enemy that is on the grid, a number will be indicated. This number represents how many enemies are in that quadrant of the grid. After blasting numerous enemies, the player will finally be able to go to the planet labeled \"B\" on the grid. These planets are unlike the other planets as they do not refill the player's vehicles energy or ammo. Rather, they are an enemy base that proceeds with the player entering a 8-bit cutscene of his space craft entering the base's gravitational orbit with the game play changing from a first person cockpit you had on the grid stage to a horizntal 2D shmup stage similar to Konami's Gradius or R-Type.

In addition, by shooting at grids in the wall, John is able to climb in the vents, dropping into a designated spot or moving down or up a floor. At the start of the game, the player character can only use a pistol (with 15 bullets) and his fists to dispose of enemies, but later acquires several weapons, such as submachine guns, explosives and flashbangs which the terrorists can also use. When McClane is shot, a few picked up items can drop where he must pick them up again. However, bullets have minimal range, only shooting straight or on a 45 degree angle. McClane's health, which is drained by bullet wounds, can be restored by collecting soda cans from either enemies, snack machines (by shooting several bullets at them) or empty rooms. The player loses the game when all life is lost. The player has about four minutes before one of the six locks are opened, but can gain more time by destroying the main computer on the fifth level. Once all the locks have been opened, the vault is opened and the game's final battle is triggered. The player has only a few minutes to go to the 30th floor, for a final confrontation with Karl, Hans and any of the 40 terrorists left alive. One interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting orders to his guards through a two-way radio. However, after the second lock is opened, Hans will tell everyone to not use the radio. Also notable is the \"foot meter\". The meter starts out full, but will eventually decrease if the player character steps on shattered glass or runs around. If the meter becomes empty, McClane will walk much slower than he does when the foot meter is full. It can be restored by collecting med-kits. The game features cinematic sequences which change the story depending on which actions the player takes. For example, if there is fewer than one minute left and the player defeats Karl, the last scene with John and Holly will tell the player the roof has been destroyed by the helicopter sent by Hans.",

So off went Daisy to get some cherries from her cupboard and there were none to be seen! \"Pogie's pinched the cherries!\" she cried, as she saw Pogie's pawprint in the cupboard. \"That darned fluffle. Come here you!\" and Pogie promptly darted off into the enchanted forest to escape Daisy's rage. Dizzy and Daisy decided to go into the forest to catch Pogie and gather some more cherries at the same time. Whilst searching for Pogie they got lost and found a castle, where they thought they would find help, but it seemed deserted. They looked in the castle for Pogie, but Daisy caught herself on a mystic spinning wheel. She started feeling really sleepy, so she found a bed and went to sleep. \"Wake up Daisy, wake up!\" shouted Dizzy. But before he could wake her up, Rockwart the troll caught him and locked him up in an underground prison! Now Dizzy must escape, wake up Daisy from her enchanted sleep, defeat Rockwart, and find the cherries along the way.",

          "description": "The video game version of Double Dare played exactly like its television counterpart. Rounds one and two were 10-question trivia rounds, each of which started with a toss-up challenge. Round three  the obstacle course  featured eight stages to be completed within 60 seconds. Toss-up challenges determined which team got initial control of the trivia round. To complete a toss-up, each player had to determine the precise speed and angle of whatever object they were throwing to hit a target.  Physical challenges were played the same way. All questions were multiple choice, and each player could use the up or down arrows on the controller to make his selection. Three possible answers and either a dare, double dare, or physical challenge option were offered. The player confirmed his selection by pressing the A button. Confirming a dare doubled the base dollar value of the question; a double dare quadrupled the base dollar value. The player with the most money at the end of round two went on to the obstacle course. In order to move through an obstacle, the player had to repeatedly alternate between pressing either the left and right or up and down arrows on the controller's D-pad. In order to grab the flag, the player had to position the on-screen contestant in just the right spot and then press the A button to jump and retrieve it. Some found it easier to get through the course by using the NES Advantage, a joystick controller, rather than the NES' standard controller. The obstacles are all based on real obstacles from the show (with one exception) and are randomized before a game. They include The Tank, The 1-Ton Human Hamster Wheel, The Fireman's Flagpole, The Monkey Bars, \"Dallas\", Mount St. Double Dare, Moonwalk, and an original obstacle designed like a triangular jungle gym. \"Prizes\" for beating the obstacle course included a BMX bicycle, television set, an NES console, and several other gifts, ending with a exotic vacation -- though it can prove very difficult to get the best \"ending\" by completing the last obstacle. The obstacle course's flag colour depended on which team was playing, if blue, the flags were blue, and if red, the flags were red.",

The battle card games are a hybrid of role playing games, board games and trading cards. The players move around a game board and encounter characters on the way. Some characters offer information and others need to be battled. The outcome of each fight is determined by the randomly generated hand of cards players and the opponent are dealt. The player flips over cards in a certain order, and their actions are shown in an animated battle that lasts until one of the characters is defeated.",

Although some of the European releases retain the Dragon Ball assets (under the title Dragon Ball), the North American release removes most references to the franchise. The game follows the first two volumes of the Dragon Ball manga, as the young monkey-tailed boy Goku (along with his teenage friend, Bulma, known in the North American version as Nora), embark on a quest to find all seven Dragon Balls (Crystal Balls in the NA version), in which it is believed that collecting them grants the user any wish they desire. Along the way, they encounter various characters, including turtle hermit Master Roshi (Hermit in the NA version), shapeshifting anthropomorphic pig Oolong (Pudgy in the NA version) and desert bandit Yamcha (Lancer in the NA version).",

          "description": "Dragon Warrior III is noted for greatly expanding upon the original Dragon Warrior and Dragon Warrior II. The game uses basic console role-playing game conventions, such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. Battle is turn-based like the other games in the series.\nDragon Warrior III features a class system, in which each character has a certain class. While the Hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose among the following: Soldier (Warrior in the GBC version), Fighter, Pilgrim (Cleric), Wizard (Mage), Merchant (Dealer), Goof-Off (Jester), Sage, and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character's stats and spells he or she can learn. Furthermore, upon reaching experience Level 20, a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of Dhama, found halfway through the game. The game starts with just the Hero in the party, who then is able to recruit a party of three at the local tavern. Unlike most Dragon Quest parties, aside from the Hero, the party is not made up of characters involved in the story. Although only four characters can be in the party at a time, extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern, allowing room for new recruits. Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles.\nThe remakes incorporated some interface changes from later games in the series, such as simplified door opening; the bag, which replaced bank item storage; the item sorting \"Tidy Item\" and \"Tidy Bag\" commands; and the \"Full HP\" command, which can be used outside of combat to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells.\nWhile the earlier Dragon Quest games were also non-linear, Dragon Quest III was the most substantial example of open-world gameplay among the early Dragon Quest games. It also allowed the player to swap characters in and out of the party at will, and another \"major innovation was the introduction of day/night cycles; certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at certain times of day.\"",

He owned six magical swords and a powerful suit of armor that was impervious to all but the most powerful of magic. Five of his six swords were Elemental blades, each created from the rarest metals on earth. The sixth blade, \"Tores\", used an even more powerful metal. Using his powers, Magi defeated Darces, and exiled him to a far away land. After defeating Darces, Magi grew old and died. Now, on a dark, stormy night in the Kingdom of Granville, Darces the Dark Overlord returns to the land. According to an old saying, \"When the shadowed veil returns to mask the midday sun, the Fire of Serpents will rise again; Five shall become the One. The elements now heed his call, and hope is born alive; We will have our peace once more when One becomes the Five.\"",

          "description": "500 years ago, the Kingdom of Granville fought a terrible war with Darces the Dark Overlord. A great hero, the warrior \"Magi\", rose to challenge Darces. He owned six magical swords and a powerful suit of armor that was impervious to all but the most powerful of magic. Five of his six swords were Elemental blades, each created from the rarest metals on earth. The sixth blade, \"Tores\", used an even more powerful metal. Using his powers, Magi defeated Darces, and exiled him to a far away land. After defeating Darces, Magi grew old and died. Now, on a dark, stormy night in the Kingdom of Granville, Darces the Dark Overlord returns to the land. According to an old saying, \"When the shadowed veil returns to mask the midday sun, the Fire of Serpents will rise again; Five shall become the One. The elements now heed his call, and hope is born alive; We will have our peace once more when One becomes the Five.\"",

Bomberman's mission is to escape his prison cell and bring Black Bomberman to justice.\n\nThe game follows the classic Bomberman formula: you are in a room full of blocks and enemies and Bomberman must plant bombs to destroy the blocks and enemies. Several blocks contain power-ups (such as blast radius increasers or fuse shorteners), and one in each level contains a door, which takes Bomberman to the next level.\nPasswords are given after game over, recording the level, number of bombs, and strength of bombs. These passwords can be entered when the game starts allowing the player to continue where he left off.\nNew to the series are the multi-player modes. Vs Mode is a 2-player mode, while Battle Mode is a 3-player mode. The objective is to kill the opposing Bomberman by planting bombs. An NES Four Score is required to play the 3-player mode.",

          "description": "Exodus is a video game that was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Color Dreams through its Wisdom Tree label in 1991. Like all Wisdom Tree games, Exodus was not officially licensed by Nintendo. According to the game's instruction manual, the player controls the biblical figure Moses as he leads the Israelites to the promised land, meaning he goes through a labyrinth. Moses has the ability to shoot glowing \"W\"s, which signify the word of God, to defeat enemies and remove obstacles. To finish each level, Moses must acquire five question marks as well as a certain amount of manna while avoiding enemies such as magicians and soldiers. After a level is completed, the player must answer five multiple choice bible-related questions before advancing to the next level. After answering enough questions correctly, the player is rewarded with an extra life. Exodus, like many Wisdom Tree games, is a modified version of a Color Dreams game, in this case Crystal Mines. It was later ported to the Game Boy. Wisdom Tree would later release a sequel to Exodus, titled Joshua, featuring slightly improved graphics and gameplay.",

(This differed from the game's packaging, which used the set from the Ray Combs era.) One or two players could play.\nJust like the show, the object was to come up with answers to survey questions posed to 100 people. Correct answers were worth money, with $200 winning the game and the right to play Fast Money for $5,000, which was played exactly the same way as on the show (at least 200 points needed to win). $5 a point was awarded for unsuccessful playings of the round.\nA player entered his answers by using the controller to scroll through the alphabet, contained in a string along the bottom of the screen; the answer had to be completed within a time limit. Reasonable similies to correct answers were accepted, and slight misspellings were also recognized.\nOnce a player won, they were given two options. The first was to stop playing, with the other being to continue on. A champion retired after winning over $20,000 automatically unless they were defeated.\nIf a computer-controlled family wins the game, no Fast Money is played with an excuse given to the form of \"Due to (EXCUSE), the (NAMES) will not be playing Fast Money today\". Excuses used include \"tax considerations\" and \"a birth in the family\".",

To succeed the player must press the pads with there feet and hands at the same time as the on screen aerobics instructor. Any missed movements are recorded on a mistake counter and 10 missed movements will fail the level. The routines (a set of repeated movements) start slow and simple with a bit of no-penalty practise time however as the player gets better the routines get more complex with less practices time. Each level has a set number of routines that increase with each level from 4 at the start to a total of 32 on the final level (level 7). At the successful completion of each level the player will get a pass stamp which they can enter later to skip that level.",

Some additional game variations are available, such as the belly bump ball (you need to roll a giant ball through the obstacle course by running into it), the crab walk (make it to the finish line walking like a crab!), the water cross (water is found on the track; if you mistime your jump and land in the water you need to swim to get out costing you valuable time), the bubble run (racing through the course inside a giant bubble), or the skateboard race.

          "description": "The game's protagonist is Bonk, a strong caveboy who battles anthropomorphic dinosaurs and other prehistoric themed enemies.  Bonk's mission is to rescue Princess Za (a small pink Pleisiosaur-type reptile) who has been kidnapped by the evil King Drool (a large, green Tyrannosaurus-type dinosaur).  In the Arcade version, Bonk is also assisted by a female version of himself.  Bonk attacks enemies by \"bonking\" them with his large, invincible forehead.  Bonk starts the game with three hearts' worth of health, which are depleted to blue as Bonk takes damage and three extra lives.  Bonk's health can be restored in increments by collecting fruits and vegetables.  Bonk can also collect pieces of meat as power-ups; these lend him special abilities and make him stronger.  There are three stages of power-up: his normal self, a second stage during which he can stun enemies by pounding on the ground and a third stage where he becomes temporarily invulnerable.  Meat can be found in two varieties: big meat and small meat.  The effects of meat are additive but wear off over time.  A small meat gives Bonk the second stage of meat power but will eventually decay into the first stage of meat power, and then back into regular Bonk.  Eating a small meat while in stage two will put Bonk into the third, invincible stage of meat power.  And eating either size of meat while in the third stage of meat power-up will reset the timer on Bonk's meat power.  Bonk can occasionally collect red heart power-ups that refill an entire heart worth of health, or even more rarely, a large red heart which restores all of Bonk's missing health.  There are also two rare, blue heart power-ups in the game which will increase Bonk's maximum health by one heart.  Bonking an enemy will typically knock it backward and slightly into the air.  Defeating an enemy yields points and also releases a small \"smiley\" power-up.  Bonk's smileys are totaled at the end of each stage after defeating the boss of that stage.  The player is given additional points and a caveman type congratulation based on how many smileys were collected.",

The Family Computer version of Field Combat was later released for the Wii's Virtual Console service exclusively in Japan on June 12, 2007.\n\nThe object of the game is to make it all the way to the end of the battlefield using the Genesis; a warship that can fire off missiles. While the player controls the blue forces, the player must defeat the Red forces without dying in the process by either avoiding or shooting helicopters, infantrymen, and tanks. An interesting characteristic of the game is that it is possible to ask for reinforcements from an army, which the player possesses, by pressing both the A and B buttons at the same time. Whenever the player runs out of units to aid him in battle, he can use his special weapon to \"absorb\" the enemies and add them to his army.\n\nThe game used Richard Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries as its background music. There is also an enemy UFO like spaceship that, when in battlefield, attempts to grab and escape with a player friendly unit (if there is any on the battlefield).It will also engage into air-to-air battle with a friendly helicopter (if there is any).",

A menu-based system allows the player to outfit each character with equipment and up to twooften disposableitems for battle. Magic spells are assigned to the character from the item menu, and certain spells, such as \"Cure\", can be used outside of battle. The player can also save their progress on the overworld. Weapons, armor, items, and magic spells can be purchased at shops, and townspeople provide useful information for the player's progression through the game. One new feature is the \"Word Memory\" system: when in conversation with non-player characters (NPCs), the player can \"ask\" about and \"memorize\" special keywords or phrases, which can later be repeated to other NPCs to gain more information or unlock new actions. Similarly, there exist a handful of special items that can be shown to NPCs during conversation or used on certain objects, which have the same effect. Characters and monsters are no longer separated into separate windows in the battle screen as they were in Final Fantasy I, and players can see their current and total hit points below the battle. Players can also fight with less than four characters in their party, which was not possible in the first game. Final Fantasy II introduced the chocobo, the signature Final Fantasy mascot, which lets characters ride to a location at great speed without being attacked by enemies. The recurring character Cid was also introduced in II; a character of the same name has appeared in every main-series game since.\n\nOn the overworld and within dungeons, (that image was banned because it came from a ROM site) random encounters with enemies can be fought to improve each character's attributes. Unlike the original Final Fantasy, players could not upgrade their characters' classes. The game is also one of the few games in the series to not use experience-based levels. Instead, each character participating in battle develops depending on what actions they take. For instance, characters who use a particular type of weapon frequently will become more adept at wielding a weapon of that type, and will also increase in physical strength and accuracy. Attributes include hit points, magic points, magic power, stamina, strength, spirit, agility, intelligence, and evasion. Players can also increase their ability to wield certain types of weapon, and repeated use in combat causes the ability to level up. Hit points (HP) and magic points (MP) increase with their use; a character who takes a heavy amount of damage in a battle might earn an increase in maximum HP, while a character who uses a lot of MP during battle might increase their maximum MP. This experience system had several unintended consequences that allowed characters to gain much more experience than intended, such as players having their characters attack each other and repeatedly cast spells, thus causing their HP and abilities to grow extensively. Final Fantasy II uses the same turn-based battle system seen in the original Final Fantasy, with battle parties consisting of up to four characters at a time. The game introduces a \"back row\" in battle, within which characters or enemies are immune to most physical attacks, but can be harmed with bows and magical attacks.",

          "description": "The gameplay of Final Fantasy III combines elements of the first two Final Fantasy games with new features. The turn-based combat system remains in place from the first two games, but hit points are now shown above the target following attacks or healing actions, rather than captioned as in the previous two games. Auto-targeting for physical attacks after a friendly or enemy unit is killed is also featured for the first time. Unlike subsequent games in the series, magical attacks are not auto-targeted in the same fashion.\nThe experience point system featured in Final Fantasy makes a return following its absence from Final Fantasy II. The character class system featured in the first game in the franchise also reappears, with some modifications. Whereas in the original game the player chooses each character's class alignment at the start of the game, Final Fantasy III introduces the \"job system\" for which the series would later become famous. Jobs are presented as interchangeable classes: in the Famicom version of the game, all four characters begin as \"Onion Knights\", with a variety of additional jobs becoming available as the game progresses. Any playable character has access to every currently available job. Switching jobs consumes \"capacity points\" which are awarded to the entire party following every battle, much like gil. Different weapons, armor and accessories, and magic spells are utilized by each job. A character's level of proficiency at a particular job increases the longer the character remains with that job. Higher job levels increase the battle statistics of the character and reduce the cost in capacity points to switch to that job.\nFinal Fantasy III is the first game in the series to feature special battle commands such as \"Steal\" or \"Jump\", each of which is associated with a particular job (\"Steal\" is the Thief's specialty, while \"Jump\" is the Dragoon's forte). Certain jobs also feature innate, non-battle abilities, such as the Thief's ability to open passages that would otherwise require a special key item. It is also the first game in the series to feature summoned creatures which are called with the \"Summon\" skill.",

          "description": "The Fire Emblem series of turn-based tactics games centers around moving units through a map grid in order to defeat the opposition. Players use strategic movements and positioning to complete mission objectives such as seizing a base, surviving for a number of turns, or defeating a boss. Many conventions of traditional console role-playing games are also present; for example, there is extensive use of scripted cutscenes to advance the story, units gain experience points and grow stronger over the course of the campaign, and the player can visit shops to outfit characters with weapons and equipment. Depending on the game, these events may take place during or in-between battles.\nThe combat system bases itself on a rock-paper-scissors method of fighting, as each weapon type has both an advantage and a disadvantage against other types. Starting in the fourth game, Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu, the weapon triangle has been lance beats sword, sword beats axe, and axe beats lance. Bows are unaffected by the triangle, can attack from a distance, and do higher amounts of damage against flying units like pegasi, but this is offset by the bow-wielder's inability to counter-attack melee strikes. A similar magic triangle exists in some games. In the Game Boy Advance Fire Emblem games, light beats dark, dark beats anima, and anima beats light. In other games, fire beats wind, wind beats thunder, and thunder beats fire. Magic and certain axes and spears can be used either from a distance or in melee range.\nUnlike in most other games, most weapons in the Fire Emblem series have a finite number of uses and will eventually break. Therefore, the player must often buy replacement weapons or spend gold to have broken weapons repaired. Typically, weaker weapons allow more uses than more powerful ones, and are often more accurate.",

The game is based on the manga series Fist of the North Star and is the second of four games based on the franchise that were released for the Family Computer in Japan and the only one with an overseas version. The game's plot is adapted from the second anime series, Hokuto no Ken 2, and covers the Gento Kken story arc. The North American version is simply titled Fist of the North Star and is not to be confused with the original Hokuto no Ken for the Famicom, which was released exclusively in Japan. Despite being based on Hokuto no Ken 2, the North American cover artwork depicts Kenshiro fighting against Toki, who appears only in the first anime series.",

          "description": "In a mysterious region of China, Ryuhi, was born and raised in high mountain tops. There he received instruction from his wise teacher, Juan. At a young age he became a master of Kempo. One day, his teacher Juan was attacked and robbed of the Secret Scrolls of Hiryu-no-Ken, of which he was the author. Ryuhi possessed the 6th volume of the Secret Scrolls, the Shingan No Sho, or Book of the Mind's Eye which Juan had managed to save. Ryuhi begins his journey to Shorinji as a last request from a dying Juan. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji welcomed the little Ryuhi, and begins to train him in Shorinji Kempo. Six years later, they received a letter of challenge from the Tusk Soldiers, a mysterious organization of enemies of the Shorinji. Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming \"World Tournament of Contact Sports\" as a representative of Shorinji. His motive is to prevent the Tusk Soldiers from becoming champions of Contact Sports at the tournament. After learning from Gengai that it was the Tusk Soldiers who attacked his teacher and robbed him of the Secret Scrolls, he leaves for the World Tournament. There are two different types of gameplay. Journey levels are side-scrolling levels where Ryuhi must defeat five bosses and find certain items valuable to the mission. The tournament levels are where the player gets to fight one-on-one against enemies in the same way as the first game in the series released in 1985, Shanghai Kid. The player must go through the game twice to get the true ending. All six scrolls must be collected the first time through to get the first ending. The second time through the player needs to collect all six scrolls again, along with four crystal balls. The crystal balls can only be found in the second quest. However, players can miss one of these items and finish the game, but the true ending will not be received.",

          "description": "The general gameplay concept is that each level is like a child's version of The Running Man with a basic top-down view. Players must throw tomatoes skillfully at a series of easy-to-hit targets. Some elements of the game are indirectly taken from the classic arcade game Pole Position (except that the player does not have the option to play as a Formula One vehicle).\nIn order to make it to the next level, the player must make it from the starting line to the finish within the time limit with a young child on inline skates. Otherwise, the player loses a chance and the player must start the stage over again. The host of the televised game show, J. D. Roth, congratulates players for winning a stage while taunting the player with late 1980s/early 1990s sarcasm when he loses a \"chance.\" Icy floors and slime colored ramps offer an additional challenge to the player. There are 72 rooms in the entire Fun House; with targets that are either numbered or given a generic target graphic. Each room has a name that usually gives a clue about how the room's design is implemented. Although the player is given three chances to successfully navigate the entire Fun House, collecting 25 silver coins acts as a 1-up. Warp zones will allow players to access the more difficult levels of the Fun House at an earlier time; thus allowing gamers who are pressed for time a chance to beat the game with a higher level of risk.",

A licorice jelly bean, for instance, will change Blobert into a ladder, while a honey jelly bean will turn him into a hummingbird.

Joe team is to eliminate any threats from Cobra and to capture eight Cobra operatives. The game cannot be completed if too many members of either side are placed in jail, other members are released to perpetuate the game.\nTwo modes of play are used; overhead vehicular combat sections, where the player controls a member of the G.I. Joe Special Forces, and one-on-one fights with Cobra operatives. In the overhead combat portion of the game, the player could select one of eight Joe team members (such as Snake-Eyes), to face off in combat against one of eight Cobra agents (such as Zartan). There are different geographical locations, such as woods, desert and arctic tundra. Each character had access to a vehicle from the G.I. Joe series, such as the Dragonfly helicopter, Rattler plane, M.O.B.A.T. or H.I.S.S. tank.\nThe one-on-one melee battle portion of the game featured sixteen characters available for the Joe team: Duke, Scarlett, Recondo, Torpedo, Snake-Eyes, Roadblock, Spirit, Zap, Gung-Ho, Snow Job, Blowtorch, Stalker, Ace, Wild Bill, Steeler, and Clutch. The Joes were pitted against eight Cobras: Destro, the Baroness, Zartan, Firefly, Cobra Commander, Storm Shadow, Major Bludd, and Scrap-Iron.",

The game ends when the player's last fighter is lost, either by colliding with an enemy or one of its bullets, or by being captured.\nGalaga introduces a number of new features over its predecessor, Galaxian. Among these is the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time, a count of the player's \"hit/miss ratio\" at the end of the game, and a bonus \"Challenging Stage\" that occurs every few levels, in which a series of enemies fly onto and out of the screen in set patterns without firing at the player's ship or trying to crash into it. These stages award a large point bonus if the player manages to destroy every enemy.\nAnother gameplay feature new to Galaga is the ability for enemies to capture the player's fighter. While the player is in control of just one fighter, a \"boss Galaga\" (which takes two shots to kill) periodically attempts to capture the fighter using a tractor beam. If successful, the fighter joins the enemy formation. If the player has more lives remaining, play resumes with a new fighter. The captured fighter flies down with the enemy that captured it, firing upon the player just like normal enemies, and can be shot and destroyed. The player can free the fighter by destroying the boss Galaga while in flight, causing the captured fighter to link up with the player's current fighter, doubling his or her firepower but also making a target twice as large.\nGalaga has an exploitable bug that can cause the attackers to stop firing bullets at the player, due to a coding error. In addition, similar to the famous \"Split-Screen bug\" in Pac-Man, a bug exists in Galaga in which the game \"rolls over\" from Level 255 to Level 0. Depending on the difficulty setting of the machine, this can cause the game to stall, requiring that the machine be reset or power-cycled in order to start a new game.",

The player can free the fighter by destroying the boss Galaga while in flight, causing the captured fighter to link up with the player's current fighter, doubling his or her firepower but also making a target twice as large.\nGalaga has an exploitable bug that can cause the attackers to stop firing bullets at the player, due to a coding error. In addition, similar to the famous \"Split-Screen bug\" in Pac-Man, a bug exists in Galaga in which the game \"rolls over\" from Level 255 to Level 0. Depending on the difficulty setting of the machine, this can cause the game to stall, requiring that the machine be reset or power-cycled in order to start a new game.",

          "description": "The objective of Galaga is to score as many points as possible by destroying insect-like enemies. The player controls a starfighter that can move left and right along the bottom of the playfield. Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen, and then begin flying down toward the player, firing bombs at the fighter. The game ends when the player's last fighter is lost, either by colliding with an enemy or one of its bullets, or by being captured.\nGalaga introduces a number of new features over its predecessor, Galaxian. Among these is the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time, a count of the player's \"hit/miss ratio\" at the end of the game, and a bonus \"Challenging Stage\" that occurs every few levels, in which a series of enemies fly onto and out of the screen in set patterns without firing at the player's ship or trying to crash into it. These stages award a large point bonus if the player manages to destroy every enemy.\nAnother gameplay feature new to Galaga is the ability for enemies to capture the player's fighter. While the player is in control of just one fighter, a \"boss Galaga\" (which takes two shots to kill) periodically attempts to capture the fighter using a tractor beam. If successful, the fighter joins the enemy formation. If the player has more lives remaining, play resumes with a new fighter. The captured fighter flies down with the enemy that captured it, firing upon the player just like normal enemies, and can be shot and destroyed. The player can free the fighter by destroying the boss Galaga while in flight, causing the captured fighter to link up with the player's current fighter, doubling his or her firepower but also making a target twice as large.\nGalaga has an exploitable bug that can cause the attackers to stop firing bullets at the player, due to a coding error.

Leonardo's weapon are the Katana Blades, which makes it easy to strike far and fast. Raphael carries a Sai in each of his three fingered fast hands. His striking range is short but a little more powerful than Leonardo. Michaelangelo uses Nunchuks, and Donatello, a master of the Bo has some serious reach and power though he is a bit slow to strike. Unlike most games, rather than just give the plot at the beginning, here the story unravels throughout the adventure. First Shredder gets Beebop and Rocksteady to capture the Turtles friend April O'Neal. Once April is rescued it turns out that Shredder has set eight bombs around the local dam. The dam though was a ploy to lure the Turtles away from their lair so that Mechaturtle, another of Shredder's minions, could kidnap Splinter.",

One hand controls the Zapper while the other must hold the controller, since the D-Pad controls your movement up and down the field. Limited ammo is also a concern, as is the ability for the computer team to snag your flag and return it to their base to win. You can chase down and tag the flag carrier yourself to prevent this.",

Never in your military career have you been in such a hot spot, as the world's most threatening power, Sheik Toxic Moron, deploys his arsenal of TechnoScorch Weapons. To achieve total victory over 4 intense levels, you must possess numerous skills, including precision reflexes for air combat, a cut throat mentality for land assaults, the brains to gather secrets from underground informants, and a keen sense for surviving 3-D battle mazes. If you've got the guts to match those skills, then prepare for action. Because it'll really heat up the second you blast across the Sheik's firing line, piloting the world's most advanced super weapon - the Mach 4 Laser Invasion Helijet, which can go from hovering to a six \"G\" vertical climb in a heartbeat. From the moment you activate your Vulcan Cannons and Sidewinder Missiles, you'll take dead aim on an insane assault, featuring Anti-Copter Rocket Launchers, High-Altitude Bombers and Aerial Mines.

He is armed with a mallet that he can swing at various enemies to defeat them, deflect certain projectiles or destroy bricks. He can also collect hearts to restore his health and carrots for bonus points. At the end of each level, Bugs Bunny had to use his mallet to defeat a Warner Brothers cartoon character such as Foghorn Leghorn, Sylvester, or the Tasmanian Devil. These other Looney Tunes characters are trying to stop Bugs because they are all jealous that Bugs gets all the attention.\nLevels:\n1: Grass land (Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird, Daffy, Wile E.

          "description": "In a mysterious region of China, Ryuhi, was born and raised in high mountain tops. There he received instruction from his wise teacher, Juan. At a young age he became a master of Kempo. One day, his teacher Juan was attacked and robbed of the Secret Scrolls of Hiryu-no-Ken, of which he was the author. Ryuhi possessed the 6th volume of the Secret Scrolls, the Shingan No Sho, or Book of the Mind's Eye which Juan had managed to save. Ryuhi begins his journey to Shorinji as a last request from a dying Juan. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji welcomed the little Ryuhi, and begins to train him in Shorinji Kempo. Six years later, they received a letter of challenge from the Tusk Soldiers, a mysterious organization of enemies of the Shorinji. Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming \"World Tournament of Contact Sports\" as a representative of Shorinji. His motive is to prevent the Tusk Soldiers from becoming champions of Contact Sports at the tournament. After learning from Gengai that it was the Tusk Soldiers who attacked his teacher and robbed him of the Secret Scrolls, he leaves for the World Tournament. There are two different types of gameplay. Journey levels are side-scrolling levels where Ryuhi must defeat five bosses and find certain items valuable to the mission. The tournament levels are where the player gets to fight one-on-one against enemies in the same way as the first game in the series released in 1985, Shanghai Kid. The player must go through the game twice to get the true ending. All six scrolls must be collected the first time through to get the first ending. The second time through the player needs to collect all six scrolls again, along with four crystal balls. The crystal balls can only be found in the second quest. However, players can miss one of these items and finish the game, but the true ending will not be received.",

In order to accomplish this, the player's characters must go to the Ark City and eventually to outer space. Unlike the Final Fantasy series, the game does not give the player an automatic \"game over\" when it is impossible to win the battle. This makes it possible for players to accidentally walk into a walking dead situation every time they are forced to do battle with the game's monsters.",

Focus your sights on the curtained windows. Squeeze off rounds of cover fire to protect your assault squad. Once your men are inside, an electronic diagram of the building's floor plan provides your only guide down to the captives - and the awaiting enemy. Look sharp. Stay frosty. Rescue is an interactive action-adventure game that lets you control each member of your strike team through three different game scenarios. Avoid searching spotlights, dodge enemy gunfire, rappel down walls, and smash through windows. Neutralize your adversaries and liberate the embassy personnel!",

This is done by selecting two tiles with matching symbols which will cause them to disappear due to the force of symmetry. However, the force of symmetry can only make two right angles at most, and can not pass through other tiles. To clear all the tiles, you will need to plan your moves carefully. To help out, you may discover one of three forces of fate under a tile which can be saved and used when you're stuck. The forces are The Flash of Chance (allows symmetry to affect any matching tiles on the board, even those surrounded by other tiles), The Force of Balance (will eliminate brick walls that block the path of symmetry) and The Flag of Knowledge (this will make your next move for you in case you can't spot what the best move is.) Also included is a level editor which lets you create your own tile challenges.",

          "description": "Different from real baseball and other baseball video games, this game consists of both male and female characters, as well as robots. All three types of players have the same basic abilities and vary only on their personal strengths. In many cases, human players are better than their robot counterparts. One major difference between the human and robot characters is that the robot characters can blow up (or lose all their power) if they are worked too hard during a game. That can happen if you constantly make them dive for a ball, run extra bases, or even if they get hit by a pitch. Under no stress whatsoever, some robots, especially pitchers, will naturally run out of power as the game progresses. When this happens, they will lose all their abilities and be useless, both offensively and defensively. When that occurs, you can either power them up or replace them with another person on the roster. Human players do not blow up, but human pitchers can tire out. When they are tired, they will pant heavily and throw the ball very slowly. This can be remedied by either an upgrade or, as in real baseball, switching to a relief pitcher.",

The game is also entirely split screen, with a second player or the computer opponent taking the controls on the second half of the secreen. Players control an aircraft pilot of either the United States or Japanese Empire. Based aboard an aircraft carrier, the player can engage in the following missions: 1vs1 dogfights, strafing runs on enemy ships, dive bombing on enemy ships, torpedo runs on enemy ships and carrier landings. All missions are made up of these elements, however campaign missions also feature the ability to decide which aircraft to bring into battle, each with it's own statistics, and keep track of progress on an area map. When two forces engage each other on this map, players can choose which plane to bring into battle and it will close in a 1vs1 battle with the enemy. In dogfights, both players control an aircraft whereas during ship combat, one player controls an aircraft and the other will control the ship's turret gun. Aircraft controls include being able to tilt left and right, climb, dive, increase speed, decrease speed, fire guns, release bombs/torpedoes (if present) and do a 180 degree loop. Turret controls are more limited, only allowing the player to aim left and right, fire the gun and zoom.",

You begin the game with a limited amount of fire power, but after shooting certain enemies power ups are left behind to increase your capabilities. Unlike many of the Darius games, if your ship is destroyed you don't lose all of the weapons you've collected; likewise you also continue on at the same point rather than being sent back to a checkpoint. Similar to many of the Darius games there are different routes that can be taken towards the final stage.

The game is based upon solving puzzles to progress to the next dungeon. In the game you play the son of the hero in the first game; Shadax. Shadax has been kidnapped by an evil witch and it is up to you to rescue him. There is a wide range of weapons and powerful magic spells you can use throughout your quest, some of which are required to solve puzzles. In Equinox, you can travel on the aboveground map as well as the underworld, although all the action except for some battles will still happen underground. If you have played any of Zelda games before, much of the game will be familiar: you must search for keys, blasting or avoiding monsters, solving physical puzzles on your way to meeting end-level guardian that you must defeat to progress.",

It was hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept.\n\nThere were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims. Firstly, the game's commentary was revolutionary at the time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.\n\nThe Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a SVGA mode for better-than-minimum system\n\nFIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it's possible to match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can also choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World Cup. If you're not satisfied with the composition of the various teams, you can create your own dream team through the custom team creator.",

The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.\n\nBy avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available, inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and during intermissions, some energy is restored.\n\nAll versions, except for the Game Boy, can be played with two players. A password system is used to save the progress.",

Each type has its own proficiencies in the drive, power, accuracy, hook, slice, and back spin categories.\n\nWhen on the golf course the player can choose a club, their stance, direction of where to hit the ball, and the power of the swing.

This is just the beginning of a new adventure that will take them Goemon and his partner all across Japan; into moutain villages, amusement parks, castle fortresses and more!\n\nPlayers control either Goemon or his partner Ebisu-Maru (or both, in 2 player mode). They sequentially travel through adventure-type villages and side-scrolling jump and run action stages. In the overhead-view villages, enemies must be defeated in order to earn money and other items (which include a weapon-enhancing lucky cat and mystical scrolls). The player is able to attack with their primary weapon and jump. Throwing weapons can also be used, which consume money for each one thrown. Attacking innocent villagers will cause the player to lose money. Money can also be gained (or lost) by visiting one of the numerous mini games, often in houses: which include mazes, whack-a-mole, the lottery, dice, a 3D labyrinth and a game trivia quiz show. Other businesses such as shops, resturants, inns and judo training can also be visited.\n\nAt the end of each village is an \"action area\" which changes the game in a complete side-scroller. One or both players can enter this place, filled with obstacles, traps, enemies and a boss creature. In addition to the regular moves used in town, players also gain the ability to unleash one of four special attacks for each character (if bought beforehand at the judo training center). These consume the scrolls collected in order to use. Additionally, in a 2 player game, characters can ride piggy-back on one another, to avoid getting stuck by a scrolling screen.",

In order to gain additional funds for the war effort, the Crown raise taxes from the New World colonies without representation. This act compels the New World colonies to protest and boycott against British rule. By 1775, the Crown alarmed by the protests, boycotts and politically instability in the New World sends troops to subdue any rebellious efforts by the New World colonists. This threatening approach provokes the Thirteen Colonies to revolt. Thus starts the War for Independence in the New World (American Revolutionary War).",

The three Vikings will have to combine their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big lizards and more.\n\nThe Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.\n\nThe player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.",

The game makes extensive use of puzzles in its dungeon layouts; various items and accessories must be used to solve them. It also features a \"Capsule Monsters\" system; monsters can be summoned to fight alongside the party in battles. They would evolve when fed weapons, armor, or special fruits.

Thanks to the efforts of Mega Man and his friends, Dr. Wily was finally brought to justice. However, Wily had always known that he might be imprisoned one day and so he had constructed four backup Robot Masters in a hidden laboratory, Burst Man, Cloud Man, Junk Man and Freeze Man. If they did not receive a communication within six months, they would begin searching for their master. After six months, the robots activate and go on a rampage throughout the city in which Dr. Wily is being held. Mega Man is called into action. Upon driving into the city with Roll and Auto, he sees that the it is in ruins and that he is too late to stop Wily's Robot Masters from liberating the evil scientist. Mega Man gives chase, but is stopped by Bass, a robot with capabilities much like Mega Man's own and his robotic wolf Treble. After a brief skirmish, Mega Man is informed that the two of them are battling Wily as well. Bass and Treble then take off, leaving Mega Man confused, but convinced that he has new allies and determined to again stop Dr. Wily's plans.",

In the year 21XX, the threat of the Mavericks had been neutralized thanks to Doppler's technology, which prevented the Mavericks from going berserk. The reformed Reploids had formed a utopia near their new mentor called Doppler Town. It seemed that all was well, until the former Maverick Reploids suddenly reverted and once again began causing trouble. Dr. Doppler was held accountable, and X and Zero were sent out to contain the new threat. Once Zero and X defeat Dr. Doppler and his forces, Dr. Doppler snaps out of it and realizes all the damage that he has done. He reiterates that Sigma's true form is now a computer virus, and he realizes that he was corrupted to create a new body for him. X seeks out Sigma after thanking the doctor. After an intense battle, the Sigma Virus in its pure form chases X in an attempt to possess him. After X finds himself at a deadend, one of two things may happen. In the main ending, Zero takes Dr. Doppler's true antivirus and uploads it onto his sabre offscreen. He rushes in to save X just in time and causes Sigma to explode, taking out the lab as they evacuate. However, if Zero was injured during the game, the worse scenario occurs - Dr. Doppler instead uses his own body as the antivirus and sacrifices himself for the greater good.",

The player controls logistics of the base to ensure that there are the necessary assets to wage war. On each map, the player places three underground command bases, if all of these are destroyed the battle is lost. The player must manage the resources of their money to construct new buildings or upgrade existing facilities on the map. Different buildings include Energy Plants, Factories, Economic Centers, Radar systems, Anti-Aircraft missiles, fake buildings and fake HQ bases, mine fields, gun pods, missile launchers, metal marine hangers and even ICBMs. At any time, the player may order an attack and choose which assets to fire at the opponent. Missiles, Metal Marines carriers and ICBMs all use different levels of fuel. Metal Marines once deployed in an area will automatically fire rifles at nearby targets or engage even closer targets in melee attacks. Gunpods, while stationary, will also fire on nearby enemies. Metal Marines are largely autonomous but can be manually controlled to a minor degree (directional) by the player.",

          "description": "Fed up with continuous losses in tournament battle, Shao Kahn, who had lost to Liu Kang in the Outworld tournament, enacts a 10,000 year-old plan. He would have his Shadow Priests, led by Shang Tsung, revive his former Queen Sindel, who unexpectedly died at a young age. However, she wouldn't be revived in the Outworld. She would be resurrected in the Earthrealm. This would allow Shao Kahn to cross the boundary lines and reclaim his queen.\nWhen Sindel is reincarnated in Earthrealm, Shao Kahn reaches across the dimensions to reclaim her. As a consequence of his action, the Earthrealm becomes a part of the Outworld, instantly stripping billions of their souls. Only a few are spared, as Raiden protects their souls. He tells them that Shao Kahn must be stopped, but he cannot interfere; due to his status, he has no power in Outworld, and Earthrealm is partially merged with Outworld.\nShao Kahn has unleashed extermination squads to roam throughout the Earthrealm and kill any survivors. Also, Raiden's protection only extends to the soul, not to the body, so his chosen warriors have to fight the extermination squads and repel Shao Kahn. Eventually with his final defeat, every human on Earthrealm comes back.\nMortal Kombat 3 follows Mortal Kombat II and shares continuity with both Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Mortal Kombat Trilogy which were both updates of this game. The next new game in the series was Mortal Kombat 4.",

He tells Shao Kahn that the invitation for Mortal Kombat cannot be turned down, and if they hold it in Outworld, the Earthrealm warriors must attend. Kahn agrees to this plan, and even restores Tsung's youth. He then extends the invitation to Raiden, who gathers his warriors and takes them into Outworld. The new tournament is much more dangerous, as Shao Kahn has the home field advantage, and an Outworld victory will allow him to subdue Earthrealm.",

One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.\n\nMs. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.\n\nSurvive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of \"Junior\".",

There were no fouls, free throws, or violations except goaltending and 24 second violations. This meant the player was able to freely shove or elbow his opponent out of the way. Additionally, the game had an \"on fire\" feature, where if one player made three baskets in a row, he would become \"on fire\" and have unlimited turbo, no goaltending, and increased shooting ability, until the other team scored (or the player had scored four consecutive baskets while \"on fire\").",

          "description": "Aside from the licenses, the gameplay for this edition sees for the first time the inclusion of the devastating one-timer shot, but to keep forwards (literally) in check, defenders also feature harder body checks, with new animations. For an additional challenge, players can also choose to control the goalkeeper manually. A popular feature in previous editions, fighting is completely removed from the game. Game modes include exhibition games (or \"regular season\" in-game), playoffs (best of one or best of seven) and an all new shoot-out mode. The main options remain basically the same couple since the establishment of the series - period length (5, 10 or 20 minutes), line changes (off, manual or the new automatic mode) and penalties. (off, on, on but no offsides).",

          "description": "Another World, also known as Out of This World in North America and Outer World in Japan, is a 1991 cinematic platformer designed and developed by Eric Chahi. Selling around 1 million copies in the 1990s,[2] Another World was innovative in its use of cinematic effects in the graphics, sound and cut scenes, with characters communicating through their facial features, gestures, and actions only. This cinematic style granted Another World cult status amongst critics and fans.\n\nOriginally developed on an Amiga 500 for the Amiga, Atari ST, Apple IIGS and DOS platforms, the game was widely ported to other contemporary systems. Later efforts resulted in several game engine recreations for the game that permitted it to run on modern computers, consoles and mobile phones. In 2006, Chahi independently released a 15th Anniversary Edition for Windows which allowed the game to be played on modern computers with original or enhanced visuals.",

          "description": "Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.\n\nThe objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a \"wall\" on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.\n\nAlso, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It's similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.\n\nThe game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.\n\nAll of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.",

Instead of offering  several generic courses, the three available (Spyglass Hill, Sawgrass and River Highlands) are in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of the console allow).\n\nThe player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were digitized), or go Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest drive, driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game (Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match and Shootout), as well as a replay.\n\nGameplaywise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to start the swing, other to set strength and a final one for accuracy. It's possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken. However, only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice levels take a few yards from the total capacity of the club.",

Princess Luna has been kidnapped by a gang of evil demons and its up to Shinto priestess Pocky and her raccoon buddy Rocky to rescue her.\n\nAs in the previous game, the gameplay involves taking control of either character to clear stage after stage of enemies in classic top-down shooter manner by blasting them with your magic cards or other collectable unique powers. New for the sequel is the ability to play with optional AI-controlled partners that add team-up special moves required to beat certain bosses as well as unique abilities that take the game in different directions (opening locks, or digging to get to the underworld sections of each stage for instance).",

To win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the vermin who worship that other god.\n\nEach god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness. Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not. To get win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on. The more followers you have you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.\n\nWhen you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero. He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy. When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people. He will burn; he will kill. And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.",

Apparently, your friend, doggie, likes to eat cookies that has his picture on their box, and he got himself so carried away that he lost the balance, and a bag of cookies fell deep down into an ant-hill. Now, you're goin' in, in a mission of solving puzzles, and retrieving the cookies for your friend.\n\nNow, this ant-hill is a bit different from the ones you saw, and especially from the one you live in. It's path is filled up with boulders, and all the gates, and you must travel the quest to find the cookies. After each different place inside, you'll fins a small bag of cookie, and bring it back to your friend doggie.\n\nThe main quest consists of you carrying your-size boulders, and placing them in a well imagined line, so when you push the exact one, all must fall, and the one that marks the end must fall the last, or the door will stay shut permanently. Beside we know that ants are very easy, and can live almost every fall, you cannot practice that, so if you jusp from a little bit too high position, don't expect much, but to retry the level.\n\nEvery block, or boulder in a game has a different markings. Like for example, the yellow ones are bricks you can push, and they will just as easily fall, and push, or not, the brick in front of it. The red ones will do the opposite, you cannot push them, and if the yellow, or any other brick hits it, it'll continue falling back to the other side. Some bricks explode when you push them, or other brick hits them, and that way they leave the hole, so your brick can continue spining, or yet again, not. Some spin without stop, 'til they hit some other brick that can fall, some replaces the spaces, like building a bridge on that place, some go high and when hit the top, they stick to it, and push, or not, the brick in front of them. Anyway, that's the game basics.\n\nEach level gives you the new code/password, so you can continue from the position where you ended each time you type that code. Perspective of your ant is like in any other platform game, and you control it with arrow keys, or joystick. But beware, the time is clicking, so you'll have to solve each level in a hurry.",

There are five stages to play in: the backyard, the Big City, the Untamed World, a zoo and a haunted house using various crazy weapons like beaver saws and watermelon bows to defeat enemies and their are also items to help them along in their quest such as rubber nipples that are used for climbing walls.\n\nThere are various obstacles and traps the players must avoid as well, like the Crockostimpy and the Happy Helmet which will temporarily incapacitate the player until it is knocked off their head.  Players can pick up health power-ups and earn points by picking up money symbols.  It also features the voice talents of Billy West.",

Well, you might end up with something like Death Valley Rally. The object is pretty simple: Race the Road Runner through each level as quickly as you can while collecting different colored flags, which are worth different amounts of points. When you reach the ending, if you're fast enough, you'll also get a time bonus, but if you're good enough, you'll get a flag bonus. Some of the flags are INCREDIBLY difficult to find, and the fact that you won't usually be able to find them, will challenge (or at least frustrate) most gamers. You can run, turbo run (by stocking up on bird seed), peck, and jump in this wild adventure, as you try to catch the escape the ever-witty Wile E. Coyote and his assorted ACME contraptions.",

While the gameplay is similar (exploring levels to collect clues and solve the mystery), there are four different episodes for this version.  While visiting the Drabwell Ranch, ghost's interrupt the festivities and the gang must find out who is behind the hauntings and why.  Another adventure takes the gang to Deadman's Cove where a ghostly pirate has been scaring off tourists and it is up to Scooby and the Gang to bring it to a halt. The other two mysteries take place at a fun fair and a haunted mansion.\n\nPlayers can use Scooby's unique sniffing ability to find clues. Scooby also consume Scooby Snacks to reduce the fright meter.  Additionally there are a series of mini-games that player can participate in such as \"Wac-A-Monster\" or \"Make a Scooby Sandwich\".  The graphics are faithfully recreated to resemble the long-running Hanna Barbara series.",

          "description": "The eponymous main character is an opossum knight who fights an army of yellow wolves and robots. He is armed with a sword that can fire energy bolts and a rocket pack that allows him to fly short distances. The gameplay remains mostly the same as in Mega Drive games, with the most notable change being the addition of a short-distance rolling dash. One major difference is that the game's final level depends on a difficulty player selected. On easy, the game culminates with battle against Axel Gear, but on normal, the story continues with Sparkster fighting the leader of the Wolves on the next level. On hard difficulty, the game continues beyond that, with the true final stage.",

          "description": "In the last years of the 20th century, the nations of the world have united to dismantle their massive arsenals of nuclear doom. With the promise of permanent world peace finally at hand, only a madman would still harbor dreams of world domination. Such a madman is the dictator of Sovinia, a small but cunning rebel nation.\n\n\"In his insane lust for power, he has joined forces with a huge, hostile war force from beyond this planet, armed with weapons more powerful than anything ever seen before by man. The Allied Countries of Earth try to resist, but without nuclear weapons, their efforts are futile. By 2008, most of the planet lies in ruins; then, in an ironic twist of treachery, the alien forces turn against their ally, and set out to complete their conquest and colonization of Earth\n\n\"Now, with the survival of the human race at stake, the allied countries join forces with the rebel dictatorship in a last-ditch effort to drive out the invaders. At their secret fortress deep in the Amazon Jungle, the greatest scientists of Earth carefully analyze the alien weaponry, and develop the weapon to end all weapons: Strike Gunner. With time running out, and few resources remaining, only two can be built; but those two can combine at will into one superfighter of astonishing power. With an awesome arsenal of offensive and defensive devices at your command, and your own unmatched courage and skill as a fighter pilot, the Earth may yet be saved",

Monsters also enter the screen periodically, which hit the bubbles and take them down a size, and can often be directed by the cable weapon.\n\nIn addition to the main Tour mode, the game also features Panic mode, in which a succession of bubbles are thrown at at the players.

Monsters also enter the screen periodically, which hit the bubbles and take them down a size, and can often be directed by the cable weapon.\n\nIn addition to the main Tour mode, the game also features Panic mode, in which a succession of bubbles are thrown at at the players. As the player progresses, the amount of bubbles required to reach the next level also increases, similar to scoring on Tetris.",

Once again the mortifying screams of helpless villagers shake the ground as they huddle against new nightmarish horrors unleashed by the Duke of Darkness, Count Dracula. And this time he has a tombstone with your name on it, Simon Belmont.\nYou must descend into Castle of the Undead and its gruesome ground, accompanied by the most chilling sound effects to ever tingle your spine. Inside, a freshly dug 11 levels maze features the treacherous Terrace of Terror, the dangerous Rotating Dungeon, the Sunken Ruins of Lost Spirits, torture chambers and creature filled caves. Use your whip like a grappling hook and swing past hundreds of traps and a host of ghost freaks, living corpses and hidden goblins. All while dodging or destroying the unpredictable spitting lizards, carnivorous coffins, and more.\nFind the concealed weapons needed to defeat everything from eerie phantoms to haunted furniture. Then prepare to find yourself face-to-thing with hideous torments like the Tongue Lasher, the Darkest Knight, the Bone-Afide Horseman and the Granite Crusher. When your nerves get shot, use your password and take a breather. But forge on, Simon Belmont, because if you though Dracula was down for the count, he's only just begun to fright!",

          "description": "Super Godzilla is a 16-bit Godzilla game where the player can take control of Toho's famous big green lizard as they rampage through Japan.  The game is divided into two main gameplay modes, Movement and Battle.  Movement has the player travel through the city using the D-pad and a map located on the bottom of the screen with the objective being to destroy certain objectives such as enemy humans and buildings as well as pick up power-ups.  There is an animation in the screen above the map that shows the results of their movements and attacks.\n\nBattle mode kicks in when the player locates an enemy on the map, like Biollante or Mechagodzilla, and is taken to a side-scrolling cinematic-style battle where the player must use punches, tail whips and the famous fire breath to drain the energy of the opposing monster.  However, the Fighting Spirit system is present which is in a sense a morality meter where the player must pick the right attacks at the right time in order to connect certain attacks.  Choosing the wrong attacks or failing to connect with them will cause the meter to drop and make Godzilla more vulnerable to attack.",

The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.\n\nSmash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.",

          "description": "Super Turrican is back, and once again the USS Freedom Forces have to prevent the evil Machine from harming innocent civilizations. \nThis requires the player to jump and shoot his way through large levels filled with lots of enemies. To get rid of all the enemies, several different weapons can be used, most of which are already familiar to players from previous installments of the series: a Laser, a Spread-shot, and a(improved) Rebound. There is also the option to go\ninto \"wheel-mode\" for a limited time to become invincible, lay mines and shoot rockets. The Flamethrower is new to the series as well as the Rope, which can be used to climb walls, cling to platforms or pick up out-of-reach items. Much like in side-scrolling shooters, you can now pick up homing missiles as secondary weapons. The biggest difference to previous Turrican-games however, is the fact that in Super Turrican 2 almost half of the levels are strictly linear and don't feature any large secret areas that have become somewhat of a trademark of the series.",

Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance. \n\nBoth players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.\n\nT2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.\n\nAssets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).",

T-800's default weapon is a pistol, but he can later acquire other weapons such as a shotgun, a mini-gun, etc. The \"good terminator\" can also use kicks and punches to dispose of the enemies. As in the movie, T-1000 appears frequently and must be fought and incapacitated, but can not be permanently killed until the ending part.\n\nAnother objective the player must complete is collecting various robotic parts that could lead to a construction of a new terminator.

          "description": "Two of the most popular puzzle games return, but now together in an exclusive compilation for SNES. The games have a slight graphical update when compared with the original Game Boy and NES games, but the gameplay remains totally faithful to the games released for both platforms.\n\nIn Tetris, the main objective is to pile blocks that will fall down continuously, in order to create a row or \"line\" without spaces. For this collection, the game comes with two bonus options: 2 PLAYER GAME (absent in the NES version) and VS. COM (absent in both versions), with 3 CPU opponents available, each one representing a difficulty level (EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD, respectively).\n\nIn Dr. Mario, the objective is to eliminate all the viruses contained in a big bottle. Dr. Mario (situated in the upper-right side of the screen) will throw capsules with 6 different color combinations (Red-Red, Red-Blue, Yellow-Yellow, Red-Yellow, Blue-Blue and Blue-Yellow) in order to line up at least four viruses or capsules of the same color horizontally or vertically and to make them disappear. In this compilation, the game comes with a bonus option: VS. COM, where you'll face the CPU players: Blue Virus (EASY), Yellow Virus (MEDIUM), and Red Virus (HARD).",

          "description": "In Tetris Attack, the player is presented with a playfield consisting of a virtual grid of squares, each of which can be occupied by a colored block. Blocks are stacked on top of one another and rise steadily toward the top of the playfield, with new blocks being added at the bottom. The player must arrange blocks in horizontal or vertical lines of three or more matching colors by swapping blocks horizontally two at a time. As matching lines are formed, the blocks are cleared from the screen and any blocks above them fall into the gaps. The game is over when the blocks touch the top of the playfield, or another game-ending condition is met (such as reaching a time limit or clearing blocks below a set line).\n\nClearing more than three tiles in a single move scores a Combo, while Chains are scored when falling blocks from one clear cause another clear to occur. Both of these events score extra bonus points, and in multiplayer Versus games, these also send \"garbage blocks\" to the other player's playfield.\n\nTetris Attack provides several single-player modes. Story Mode takes the player through the game's main plot, pitting the player against a series of foes in a head-to-head match. The objective is to cause the computer-controlled player to lose. In Endless Mode, the player is challenged to play as long as possible with a continuously rising stack of blocks, which increases in speed over time. Timed Mode challenges the player to score as many points as possible within a two-minute time limit, and Stage Clear mode takes the player through a series of stages in which the objective is to clear blocks below a set line. A Puzzle Mode is also provided, which presents the player with a number of puzzles where he or she must clear all of the blocks in a set number of moves (Blocks do not rise in this mode).\n\nIn addition to the game's single-player modes, Tetris Attack also provides several multiplayer modes that are essentially two-player variants of the single-player modes. One or both human players may be substituted with a computer-controlled player with a selectable difficulty level.",

The idea is simply to get a touchdown, while as usual progressing at least ten yards in four downs.  There are two plays: a running play, where you simply run as far as possible while avoiding the opposing team; and a passing play that starts with a pass that can gain you extra yards, but must be caught.\n\nBetween levels there are bonus games.

But is it really his handiwork, or is there someone else controlling him? Unravel the mystery while traveling to various locales, fighting Von Hesler's henchmen and picking up (CPU-controlled) companions along the way.\n\nSpike McFang has three main methods of attack: by striking out with his cape, throwing his hat like a boomerang, or using a magic card. Cards can also heal his health or give his companions extra strength. Spike can also devour the still-beating hearts of his vanquished foes (or the dropped tomatoes of his vanquished foes if you're playing the sanitized North American version) to regain health. There are a total of four different hats that Spike can purchase as upgrades in his battle against animated garlic bulbs, bomb-throwing cats, head-spinning plants and a plethora of other dangerous enemies.",

Something went wrong however, and three new life forms turned against their creators: Brutally savage Orcs, cybernetic androids called Cromes and genetically enhanced human soldiers code named M.A.R.S. Players take control of a secretly assembled force and must try to restore order.\n\nWar 2410 is a turn-based strategy game in which players move various units, such as mechs, tanks, troops or planes over a grid-map. Units differ in movement and attacking range. Some ground units cannot attack air units and vice versa. Terrain also affects combat as some types of terrain, like trees or buildings improve a units defense. Attacked units always counterattack as long as the attacker is within range. The goal of most missions is to destroy all enemy units, while it is sometimes necessary to capture the enemies' bases. Units cannot not be improved or modified and every mission starts with all units already in place.",

          "description": "Wario's Woods is a puzzle game similar to Tetris or Columns, but with a twist. Instead of directly controlling the monsters and bombs that are falling down, the player controls Toad who has to carry around stacks of monsters and bombs and to combine them in the right way. One bomb plus at least two monsters of the same color have to be combined to make them disappear. If five or more objects are cleared at the same time, a diamond will appear. Destroying the diamond will clear all monsters of the diamond's color.\nThere are four different ways to pick up objects. The A button lets Toad pick up the whole stack that is in front of him, the B button lets him only pick up one object, even if it's in the middle of a stack, the Y button lets him kick a monster or bomb that's in front of him and the X button places him on top of the stack that he is carrying. He can also run up walls and stacks to catch falling objects out of the air or to pick up certain parts of a stack.\n\nThere are 5 different modes of play: a \"Round Game\" in which Toad has to clear numerous levels, a match versus a computer controlled opponent, a two player mode, a \"Time Race\" mode, and finally, an extensive training mode.\n\nThere are some differences between the SNES and NES versions. Due to a lack of buttons, controls are a little different in the NES version (although all the moves from the SNES version are present). Also, there is no vs. mode against the computer, but the \"Round Game\" mode features two modes of play: one that includes boss-fights on every level ending with a 9.",

However, Xavier suspects Apocalypse to follow his own plans and sends five X-Men, Cyclops, Wolverine, Psylocke, Beast and Gambit, to investigate.\n\nX-Men: Mutant Apocalypse combines the gameplay of a side-scrolling brawler like Final Fight with elements of a platformer, that is, players have to fight various enemies and survive the occasional jumping-puzzle. Most levels also feature mid- and end-bosses in form of robots, monsters or known Super-Villains.\n\nEach character has unique abilities and special moves: Cyclops uses his Optic Blast to attack enemies from a distance, Wolverine can climb walls, Psylocke is very agile and the best jumper of the team, Beast can cling to the ceiling while Gambit throws explosive cards at his enemies. Special moves are quite similar to those found in Street Fighter II (Wolverine has a Dragon-Punch-style attack and Gambit's Double Kick is virtually identical to M. Bison's Scissors Kick), and require similar button combinations.\n\nWhile most stages are unique for each character, some can be played with any of the X-Men. Progress is saved via password.",

There is a robot named Triton, a cat-like quadruped named Panthera, and a giant red bipedal insect alien name Alcedes. The single player of the game controls one of these characters at a time and can switch at any time. If the current character loses all of his health, the player is sent back to the start of the level and that one character receives a health refill.\n\nEach character has special attributes that help the team. For example, Panthera's relatively small size allows him to squeeze into spots where the other 2 characters can not travel. The characters can gather a number of unique powerups and weapons to help them on their mission.",

In order to keep the duo busy, he also frees the Joker, Two-Face and the Mad Hatter, each one with their own agenda. The Joker celebrates his birthday wreaking havoc in Gotham and stealing diamonds, Two-Face tries to take over the city from above, and Mad Hatter is creating a robot army in his surreal lair.\nThe game can be played by two players simultaneously; one player with Batman, and the other with Robin. Both characters are identical in terms of playability, and both use batarangs, bolas, or shirukens in long-range attacks, while using melee attacks at short range. There are four levels consisting of several stages, mostly of a straight left-to-right traverse to the end where the boss awaits. In some levels the game switches to a side-scrolling shooter, in which the players must control the Batwings.\nThe game is regarded as being extremely difficult to complete, and also known for showcasing some of the most impressive special effects on the Mega Drive/Genesis. It also features a soundtrack by Jesper Kyd. This accounts for the relatively high quality of Kyd's compositions, as well as the fairly simple FM synthesized nature of the game's sound effects.",

Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.\n\nThe game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. You also can speed up and slow down to deal with enemies which appear behind you.",

The Sultan's guards and also animals of the desert want to hinder Aladdin in his way. He can defend himself with his sword or by throwing apples. Next to apples, Aladdin can also collect gems which can be traded for lives and continues with a traveling trader. Finding Genie or Abu icons enables bonus rounds. The Genie bonus round is a game of luck played for apples, gems or extra lives, and continues until the player runs out of Genie tokens or lands on Jafar. In Abu's bonus round, the player controls the little monkey who has to catch bonus items that fall from the sky, but without touching any of the unwanted objects like rocks and pots.",

Thus, it crash lands on the prison colony planet Fiorina 161.

This game takes four scenes from the Hollywood movie Back to the Future III and turns them into arcade sequences:\nBuckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley's lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective.\nShooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets.\nPie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It's an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back.\nThe Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and collect speed logs to push the engine to a magic 88 mph.",

When Jason woke up, SOPHIA 3rd NORA MA-02, which he had hidden in an abandoned barn, was in pieces and the parts he had collected four years ago from the Plutonium Boss' mutant Underbosses were missing. Little did Jason know that there were more Lightning Beings, the kinfolk of the Plutonium Boss, and they were planning to destroy the Earth. These beings started digging towards the Earth's core in order to shift the planet's weight off its axis, leading to total annihilation while they sapped the underworld of plutonium. The parts from SOPHIA 3rd were being used to create a template for the robotic army to assist the Lightning Beings in accomplishing their mission. Jason knew he had to stop them, but he also knew he wouldn't make it without the help of SOPHIA 3rd. Since he couldn't recover the parts, he decided to redesign & reconstruct it with (assumedly) the help of Eve to better prepare himself for the ordeal facing him. After 29 days, SOPHIA was completely rebuilt and ready for battle again, now known as SOPHIA 4th.\n\nFollowing the Beings' footsteps, the group jumped in their new vehicle and headed towards the (presumably) Adirondack Mountains, where their quest began anew. In the end, Jason and company triumphed over the Lightning Beings' underworld invasion, vanquishing the Lightning being known only as the \"Mutant Boss.\" SOPHIA 3rd's parts remained missing.",

Of course, Death appeared and challenged Chakan with a proposition. If Chakan could defeat him, he'd be granted eternal life. However, if Chakan was defeated, he'd become Death's eternal servant. In another side-story, Chakan was so feared by the elders of multiple tribes, they dropped their petty differences and amassed to figure out a way to defeat or contain him, and upon overhearing his boasting, summoned the Grim Reaper themselves, informed the Reaper of his boastings, and contracted him to defeat Chakan.\n\nThe battle raged on for several days, spells and swords clashed, until the ultimate victor was very clear...Chakan. Because he defeated Death eventually, he was granted his \"reward\":\n\n\"You are a tactful swordsman, so I will not renege on our wager. I grant you the kiss of eternal life, but, for your arrogance and pride I will temper my gift with this curse. You will be a mere shell of yourself as I strip you of most of your powers. Each nightfall, evils will be shown to you, and the pain of their victims will be your pain. You will never know rest as you wander this world searching to slay the horrors that haunt your sleeping world. You will suffer grievous wounds, but you will not die, and as eternity rolls on, you will crave my touch. Your face will bear my visage, and your eyes will burn with hellfire. But...let it not be said that I am without mercy. There shall be an end to your curse. If all the beasts of the dark are slain, then you may find rest.\"\n\nChakan will live forever until he destroys the four supernatural evils of the terrestrial plane (Spider-Queen, Mantis, Elkenrod, and Dragonfly King) and the elemental plane (Parasite, Tundra Beast, the Last Dragon and the Leader of the Dragonfly Clan).",

When a player makes 2 baskets in a row, the announcer says \"He's heating up\", and if he makes 3 baskets in a row without the other team scoring, he says \"He's on fire!\", which makes it easier to score.\nIn the season mode, the player can pick from 44 teams, and then play a 20 game season against quality competition. In the tournament mode, 16 teams compete for a chance to win the national championship. The player also has the ability to edit teams and players. The game itself is not realistic, as players can easily make full-courts shots and occasionally, players get struck by lightning as they dunk. The final score of the games are usually in the middle to high 100s.",

          "description": "The game takes place inside a tall, rectangular playing area, as in Tetris. Columns of three different symbols (such as differently-colored jewels) appear, one at a time, at the top of the well and fall to the bottom, landing either on the floor or on top of previously-fallen \"Columns\".\n\nWhile a column is falling, the player can move it left and right, and can also cycle the positions of the symbols within it.\n\nIf, after a column has fallen, there are three or more of the same symbols connected in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, those symbols disappear. The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this causes three or more other symbols to become aligned, they also disappear and the pile settles again. This process repeats as many times as necessary. It is not uncommon for this to happen three or four times in a row - it often happens by accident when the well is becoming crowded. If the well fills beyond the top of the screen, the game ends.\n\nOccasionally, a special column called the Magic Jewel appears. The Magic Jewel flashes with different colors and when it lands, it destroys all the jewels with the same color as the one underneath it.\n\nLike Tetris, the columns fall at a faster rate as the player progresses. The goal of the game is to play for as long as possible before the well fills up with symbols.\n\nSome ports of the game offer alternate game modes as well. \"Flash columns\" involves mining their way through a set number of lines to get to a flashing jewel at the bottom. \"Doubles\" allows two players work together in the same well. \"Time trial\" involves racking up as many points as possible within the time limit.",

Before each game, the player can spend Pheelae (money) on repairs and determine what weapons to take into battle. Each opponent has specific weaknesses and they can hide behind walls on the battlefield. To take them out, Jade needs to choose the most effective weapons and target specific parts before he runs out of time and ammo. Weapons include missiles, rockets, grenades that slow the opponent down, a machine gun and more. Only three weapons can be acquired at all times. Between missions there are short gallery shooting mini-games where additional money can be acquired.",

Take too much damage and it's game over! After each race, winnings can be used to upgrade or repair the vehicle. There are three difficulty levels, which affect how quickly the vehicle takes damage. There is also a practice mode where the player can freely choose any track.",

Player names, on the other hand, were made by mixing names found on real squads. Portuguese teams, for instance, had a large number of Yugoslavian players in the early 1990s, and that was reflected by players with names such as Valentim Ivic (of Valentim Loureiro and Tomislav Ivic, then Boavista FC chairman and S.L. Benfica manager, respectively). Names could not be changed, and since the game lacked a battery, it does not store changes done to kits and passwords were used to resume tournaments (example of a password sheet). Rotherham United are included amongst the English clubs despite never playing in the top tier of English football, this is due to the developer, Krisalis Software, being based in Rotherham.

These two versions would be remade for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993 and 1994, respectively.\nThough the games do have a TMSS check, they will only do the $A14000 write if they detect the region of the console they are running on as US  therefore, the games will only boot on either any US Mega Drive or on any other Model 1 Mega Drive without TMSS (making that a partly useless form of region lockout).\n\nGameplay of both versions is identical: you are the main character (Moses or Joshua, respectively) and you must collect all the bags with M on them (Joshua: coins with $ on them) scattered throughout each maze. A and C shoot; you can hold them down for rapidfire. Shooting destroys blockades and enemies. Once all the M bags are gathered, find the exit to move on to the next level. In between each level, you must answer a bunch of questions related to the story of the Bible of the game's theme; getting them wrong appears to be inconsequential to the outcome of the game (this needs investigation).",

Although there are no combos available, the attack key offers different moves and a few special moves are available as well.

Aside from the moves, some are also faster or come with more powerful attacks. The game modes include matches for one or two players and a watch mode to view a computer-computer fight.",

The king then summons Bop and Bump to reclaim his stolen possession from Thump.\n\nGameplay consists of flying through six air and water levels: Gadget Bay, Zeppelin Attack, The Lost City, Sub Attack, The Crystal Lake and Thump's World. Although the game continually scrolls throughout its stages, the player can fly in all directions on the screen. Bop and Bump come equipped with a spring glove mechanism that lets the player punch either up, down, right or left, which is used to defeat enemies.\n\nDefeated enemies drop coins. There are also chests littered throughout the stages which contain coins also. These coins can be spent at a shop where the player can purchase upgrades.\n\nThe game also contains bonus stages where the objective is to open all the chests in a limited amount of time.",

The space terrorists, Gulfer, plan to harvest the pollution to make some sort of garbage weapon. The good guys, the Leezaluth, aren't happy about that, so they decide they have to blow up the Earth before Gulfer gets at it. They give Earth an ultimatum: destroy Gulfer or Leezaluth destroys Earth. To help them out, Leezaluth gives Earth's last hero, Dan, a special weapon: the TOZ system.\n\nWhy don't the Leezaluth just stop Gulfer themselves? It's not exactly clear.\n\nSo, we have the premise for a side scrolling shooter. The star attraction here is the TOZ system. The TOZ is an orb that follows your ship around, and can be shot at enemy ships to absorb their weapons. Using the TOZ, Dan will fight through 8 stages filled with lots of enemies and really large bosses.",

An evil entity known as Death Adder has captured the King and his daughter, and holds them captive in their castle. He also finds the Golden Axe, the magical emblem of Yuria, and threatens to destroy both the axe and the royal family unless the people of Yuria accept him as their ruler. The character of Death Adder and the stolen Golden Axe could well be traced to the historical event of the Acquisition of the True Cross during the Sassanid-Byzantine wars, as the Norse mythology is heavily influenced by Greek and Middle Eastern mythologies.\nThe player controls one of three Warriors. The first is a battle axe-wielding dwarf, Gilius Thunderhead, from the mines of Wolud, whose twin brother was killed by the soldiers of Death Adder. Another is a male barbarian, Ax Battler, wielding a two handed broadsword looking for revenge for the murder of his mother. The last is a long-sword-wielding Tyris Flare, an amazon, whose parents were both killed by Death Adder.",

In addition to the weapons, the player can engage enemies in close quarters combat. It is possible to grab and toss enemies, perform sliding and jumping attacks and a long-range skid.\n\nUnlike most games in the genre, the player has a life total calculated in numbers. Death to a player requires multiple hits but just one death will issue the option to continue from the start of the level or to end the game. Players have unlimited continues.\n\nThe main highlight of the game are its boss encounters, which often feature large enemies made up of multiple sprites allowing for fluid movement.",

There are two jumps available, the ball jump suitable for height and the hurdle jump, suitable for distance. Both allow Izzy to clear an enemy, but the second harms him.If Izzy is hit, then he must find three medals, or at the next hit he loses a life. There are some extra objects, like Olympic torches, and eggs that hatch either objects for bonus points, trampolines or morph points to reach otherwise inaccessible areas or traps.

The objective of the game is simply rescuing a group of girls who were kidnapped by a rival tribe of cavemen. The gameplay is somewhat similar to Contra and has a Gauntlet-style health system, where the player loses health over a period of time apart from in boss battles. This health system is also not unlike that of Sega's Wonder Boy. The game could be played in either single player or two player mode. In the two player mode, both characters could hurt each other. The game was also notable for its cartoony graphics, humor, and sound effects.\n\nThe original arcade version had the distinction of allowing the player to select between different routes (much like Taito's Darius) at the end of a boss battle. Also, after defeating the final boss, the players can choose between three exits, each one leading to a slightly different ending sequence.",

These two versions would be remade for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993 and 1994, respectively.\nThough the games do have a TMSS check, they will only do the $A14000 write if they detect the region of the console they are running on as US  therefore, the games will only boot on either any US Mega Drive or on any other Model 1 Mega Drive without TMSS (making that a partly useless form of region lockout).\n\nGameplay of both versions is identical: you are the main character (Moses or Joshua, respectively) and you must collect all the bags with M on them (Joshua: coins with $ on them) scattered throughout each maze. A and C shoot; you can hold them down for rapidfire. Shooting destroys blockades and enemies. Once all the M bags are gathered, find the exit to move on to the next level. In between each level, you must answer a bunch of questions related to the story of the Bible of the game's theme; getting them wrong appears to be inconsequential to the outcome of the game (this needs investigation).",

The climax of the game mirrored the unused climax of the film, in which Grant must defeat a pair of Velociraptors by causing the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton in the Visitors Center to collapse on top of them. Grant himself is the final boss in the same location for the raptor storyline: your dinosaur character must cause the bone structure to collapse via specifically placed kicks to cause Grant to flee. A sequel was released using a new game engine and new artwork (with some of the original art as well), entitled Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition. In it, Grant's helicopter (that he just escaped on in the first game) crashes. Now he must deal not only with dinosaurs, but InGen as well. A new raptor must also make it off the island.",

Due to these radical changes, the game was met with controversy upon release.

The AI has been boosted and can now hurry in two-minute drill situations, spike the ball, and cover the receivers with better efficiency.\n\nAmong the innovations in Madden 96, the Create A Player feature was added, which included many position specific mini-games that would determine the ability of the player.\n\nThe game also was the first in the Madden series to include secret \"classic\" teams, which were unlocked by playing any of the 28 pre-expansion NFL franchises in the playoffs and by winning Super Bowl XXX with that team (a rather easy feat as the playoff tournament system allows a player to abort the game while in the lead and still win). The 28 pre-expansion teams were each represented by a classic era equivalent, which ranged from 1960 (Philadelphia Eagles) to 1986 (New York Giants), although all players identified as number-only. Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina Panthers, having debuted in 1995, did not have a secret classic team revealed in this manner, nor did the All-Madden team. However, Carolina was attached to the blank slate NFLPA team used for Create-A-Player, and Jacksonville and All-Madden hid the \"superteams\" with players named after the developers; these teams were accessed using unstated cheat codes.",

Unlike the first game, enemy encounters occur at set points rather than spawning randomly, though enemy type selection is still random.",

He would have his Shadow Priests, led by Shang Tsung, revive his former Queen Sindel, who unexpectedly died at a young age. However, she wouldn't be revived in the Outworld. She would be resurrected in the Earthrealm. This would allow Shao Kahn to cross the boundary lines and reclaim his queen.\nWhen Sindel is reincarnated in Earthrealm, Shao Kahn reaches across the dimensions to reclaim her. As a consequence of his action, the Earthrealm becomes a part of the Outworld, instantly stripping billions of their souls. Only a few are spared, as Raiden protects their souls. He tells them that Shao Kahn must be stopped, but he cannot interfere; due to his status, he has no power in Outworld, and Earthrealm is partially merged with Outworld.\nShao Kahn has unleashed extermination squads to roam throughout the Earthrealm and kill any survivors. Also, Raiden's protection only extends to the soul, not to the body, so his chosen warriors have to fight the extermination squads and repel Shao Kahn. Eventually with his final defeat, every human on Earthrealm comes back.\nMortal Kombat 3 follows Mortal Kombat II and shares continuity with both Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Mortal Kombat Trilogy which were both updates of this game.

Kahn agrees to this plan, and even restores Tsung's youth. He then extends the invitation to Raiden, who gathers his warriors and takes them into Outworld.

Up to four players can compete simultaneously in venues ranging from a rooftop and jungle arena to a harbor and city court. Enter in codes to unlock hidden characters, power-ups, and other bonuses.

There were no fouls, free throws, or violations except goaltending and 24 second violations. This meant the player was able to freely shove or elbow his opponent out of the way. Additionally, the game had an \"on fire\" feature, where if one player made three baskets in a row, he would become \"on fire\" and have unlimited turbo, no goaltending, and increased shooting ability, until the other team scored (or the player had scored four consecutive baskets while \"on fire\").",

          "description": "NHL 97 is an ice hockey video game by EA Sports. It was released on October 31, 1996 and was the successor to NHL 96. It is the sixth installment of the NHL series and the first to be released on both PlayStation and Saturn.\n\n\nNHL 97 took the graphics even further ahead, using a full 3D engine, with motion captured polygonal players (PC/PlayStation/Saturn versions only, the Mega Drive and SNES versions retained similar graphical values to previous games, but with further enhanced animations). Each goaltender has his own custom-painted mask and the original artwork can be seen inside the game with a special \"Goalie Mask Viewer\". NHL 97 also introduces play-by-play commentary, provided by well-known announcer Jim Hughson.\n\nFor the first time since EA Hockey, national teams were added, but only Canada, the United States, and Russia have their own teams while the other two are selections of the best European players. NHL 97 introduced a skills competition, allowing the user to pick players to compete in drills such as hardest shot, goalie 2 on 0, and accuracy shooting, among others.\n\nThis was the first year of the \"Third Jersey.\" Teams that had available third jerseys for NHL 97 were, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Boston Bruins, Los Angeles Kings, Pittsburgh Penguins & Vancouver Canucks. These were the first teams to try out the third jersey. To activate the alternate uniform left click on the teams banner in the controller setup.\n\nIn addition, each team in the game had one player with a special skill. Examples are Joe Sakic's (Colorado Avalanche) \"wrong-footed wrist shot\" and Rob Ray's (Buffalo Sabres) ability to check an opposing player while still controlling the puck. A major flaw in the game was the glitch that allowed players to score 100% of the time when shooting down by taking a shot against the boards at the hash marks of the left circle in the bottom zone.\n\nAlong with the PC, Mega Drive/Genesis and SNES versions, both the Sega Saturn and PlayStation version made their debut, although they were rushed and buggy. For instance, the shot speed in the PlayStation and Saturn versions was so slow that some skaters could beat a slapshot down the ice. The cover of the game features Florida Panthers goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck",

Pac-Man himself walks around in a cartoon world and interacts directly with the player, as well as with objects and other characters. The player cannot control Pac-Man directly, but instead can direct his attention in various directions, and is armed with a slingshot that can be used to strike certain objects, including Pac-Man himself.\nPac-Man's mood varies throughout the game, usually in response to his environment or the player's actions, and generally his mood affects his actions and his willingness to cooperate with the player; the varieties of \"bad\" moods can at time compromise the player's ability to progress. There are a few instances, however, where Pac Man is required to be angry. Hitting objects with the slingshot can often get Pac-Man to look at that object and piece together parts of the puzzle he is currently trying to solve - for example, hitting a door may cause Pac-Man to go inside a house to discover a clue. But beware - a few objects when hit can also produce disastrous (and humorous) results. Hitting a trash can on a city street at the wrong time, for example, can cause a cat to jump out and attack Pac-Man.\nThroughout the game, Pac-Man is occasionally harassed by the four ghosts from the classic Pac-Man games. When this happens, Pac-Man is paralyzed by fear and eventually faints, unless the player gives him a power pellet. Then Pac-Man becomes Super Pac-Man for a brief time and flies around, eating the ghosts. In some cases, the ghosts may leave behind important objects.",

Players must explore both overworld maps and dungeons in order to progress through the game.\n\nPhantasy Star III mostly follows the traditional roleplaying game formula seen throughout the series, with exploration of several 2-D worlds, character recruitment, and random enemy encounters using a turn-based battle system. Unlike previous games, the series staple of \"techniques\" play a diminished role in combat, which is ironic considering the role they play in differentiating the game's two major factions - with techniques being exclusive to Layans, and viewed as \"evil magic\" by the Orakians.",

The game also has no predetermined end, although as time goes on, it becomes more difficult to recruit crew members. Also, as the player character ages, fighting becomes more difficult, and deteriorating health will eventually force the character into retirement.

In a Grudge Match, the player must fight against a CPU controlled clone of his or her fighter (if playing alone) or the other players in a multiplayer game. Each player has three \"knockdowns\" - getting knocked down three times eliminates them from the Grudge Match, the winner is the last man standing. This match plays more like a bonus round, in that there is only results are gaining or failing to gain bonus money, and losing the Grudge Match does not eliminate a player.\nThe final battle, the \"Championship Match\", is between the player and the mysterious entity that taunts between matches every once in a while, the Masked Warrior. If more than one person is playing the game before this match, they must fight each other to the death until only one becomes victorious and can fight him.\n\n\nBuzz posing after taking down the Executioner.\nThe player must jump, punch, and kick their opponent until his/her energy runs out. If the player presses all three of the buttons at a time, the character will perform a \"super move\".\nSometimes during matches the player will come across foreign objects such as knives, crates, sticks, motorcycles, and bar stools that can be thrown at you or your opponent. The player may also come across a power-up known as the \"power pill\". If the player or the opponent grab this item, one will become temporarily stronger and take less damage from hits.\nSometimes even the crowd will interfere in the fights. Two characters, known as Knife Man and Knife Woman, will come out of the crowd and stab the player with their daggers. The player can take these nuisances out with one hit. Sometimes there is also a fat bearded man with a stick. If the player knocks him down, the player can take the stick and use it against the current opponent.\nThe audience will also push any fighter that ends up among them, and stays there more than a few seconds.

Under threat of global nuclear war the dictator has begun to annex his neighbor countries, with plans to continue his territorial expansion, so three special operatives are covertly sent in with a lone gunship to remove his ability to wage war.\n\nThe majority of the game consists of air-to-ground attack while flying in the Apache, using its hefty loadout of rockets, guided missiles, built-in 30 mm cannon and defensive infrared air-to-air missiles in order to eliminate the hostiles from the air, land and sea. Fuel drums, repair kits and ammunition depletion are both factors to keep in mind, and careful planning of where the pickups are located so that the chopper is able to stay in the air and is able to keep fighting, elements that are very similar in implementation to the Strike series.

It follows Taro Yamada (or \"Rent A Hero\"), a hero for hire that needs to complete various tasks to save the day.\n\nThe game borrows the engine used in Phantasy Star III, however instead of turn-based battles enemies are defeated through a versus-fighting system similar to Street Fighter II.\n\nThough mostly unknown to the western world, Rent A Hero has been referenced several times across Sega products, including Fighters Megamix in which Taro is an unlockable character.\n\nThe game was remade for the Sega Dreamcast as Rent A Hero No.1. It has also been re-released as part of the Wii's Virtual Console service in Japan.",

Some levels are horizontal scrolling shooters (akin to Gradius, often with in-level references to that game), while one level has the player control a large machine to duel with Axel Gear.",

You begin the game inside a training simulation, which upon successful completion ensures your transfer to the crew of the seaQuest DSV where you will be called upon to perform the same duties.\n\nPrimarily, your function is to navigate the seaQuest Deep Submergence Vessel around the underwater map to various 'mission areas' where you will be called upon to use the on board vehicles to accomplish some task. Typical missions include salvage operations, rescue operations, disarmament of underwater explosives, termination of enemies and exploration. Damage of underwater property is deducted from your budget and completion of objectives adds to it. The money must be used to resupply weapons and buy additional vehicles. Underwater is a dangerous place.\n\nThe vehicles you have at your command includeSpeeder: A simple two-man vessel designed entirely for speed. It is also a combat vessel and may fire forwards, move up & down and change orientation between facing left and facing right\nStinger: A prototype \"next generation\" attack vessel, this one-man sub allows you to orientate in any direction to fire your weapon accurately.\nSea Crab: A slow vehicle used for excavation, mining, and rescue missions. It is the only vessel that can dock with other vessels and one of only two that can pick up undersea objects for transport. It comes with a water jet to clear debris and a retractable drill\nSea Truck: Slow and bulky, this vessel may move up and down and change it's orientation between left and right. It's weapons are torpedoes and mines which may be dropped behind it. Furthermore it can also pick up undersea objects for transport\nRemote (HR) Probe: Small and agile, this vehicle contains only a very simple weapon. It's main purpose however is underwater welding and repair of objects. It can also activate switches\nDarwin - Intelligent Dolphin and seaQuest mascot: Darwin the Dolphin is perhaps the most agile of the vehicles, and may take off in bursts of speed. However Darwin has no weapons with which to defend himself and is very vulnerable. Darwin is able to get into tiny spaces that none of the other vehicles can reach. Darwin is able to activate switches.",

When not in combat, the player can explore towns and other locales, talk with people, and set the members and equipment of the army. Some towns have a headquarters where the player can inspect and talk with his allies. While roaming through town or moving throughout the world, one can find both visible and hidden treasures and interact with certain objects.\nEach ally unit is represented by a character with a background and personality. Some of these characters are hidden, requiring specific events to occur before they will join the force. Each ally unit also has a class, which defines the abilities for that unit. These abilities range from what type of weapons they can use to what kind of spells they can learn. Units can become stronger by fighting enemies and performing various actions which gives them experience points (EXP), which allow them to gain levels. Once a unit reaches level 20, that character has the ability to advance to more powerful class through promotion. Some characters have two different classes they may be promoted to, one of which is only accessible using a special hidden item.\nBattles take place on a square grid, and each unit occupies a single square. Battle is turn-based. Each turn, a character can move and perform one action: either attack, cast a spell, or use an item. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping an item during the turn, do not count as actions.\nThe battle is won if all enemies are defeated, or if the enemy commander is defeated. If Bowie is defeated in combat or withdraws, the battle is lost and the player is returned to the nearest town, where he can recover his allies and fight the same battle again.",

He also has to collect enough \"proof\" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are \"using\" human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.\n\nThe ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.",

As the satellite falls back to the Floating Island, landing in a volcanic crater, Sonic jumps off, landing in a mushroom filled woodland.\nSonic knows there are many Chaos Emeralds hidden on the island, including the powerful Super Emeralds and the Master Emerald, the secret to the island's levitation powers. Worried that Robotnik may try to harness this power to fuel a repaired Death Egg, he sets off to try and destroy the Death Egg once and for all, keeping an eye out for Knuckles the Echidna, still smarting from his Launch Base defeat.\nAt Hidden Palace, Sonic finds Knuckles there waiting for him. They fight and Sonic seems to emerge victorious when Knuckles flees from the duel after sensing someone is trying to steal the Master Emerald. Knuckles races ahead closely followed by Sonic to find Robotnik trying to steal the Master Emerald: It had been his plan all along to snatch it while Sonic and Knuckles were too busy dealing with each other. Realizing he had been tricked, Knuckles reacts by attacking Robotnik, which fails when Robotnik electrocutes Knuckles. Sonic tries to intervene but Robotnik stills manages to escape. Knuckles now realizes his mistake and that Sonic is in fact on his side. They join forces and teleport to Sky Sanctuary.\nAt Sky Sanctuary, Knuckles and Sonic watch the Death Egg launching in the background. Knuckles activates a bridge so Sonic can cross over. Sonic defeats a rebuilt Metal Sonic on the way to the Death Egg, and manages to board it before it leaves the atmosphere. Onboard the Death Egg, Sonic defeats Robotnik and destroys the ship once and for all, only for Robotnik to get away with the Master Emerald in one of his giant robots. If Sonic hasn't collected all seven Chaos Emeralds and/or Super Emeralds, the game ends here, and the ending in which the Master Emerald does not return to Angel Island occurs. After the credits, the player sees a scene with Robotnik still in possession of the Master Emerald.\nIf all the seven Chaos Emeralds and/or Super Emeralds are collected, Sonic transforms into Super Sonic or Hyper Sonic and chases Robotnik into the Doomsday Zone. After failing to lose him in an asteroid belt, Robotnik's machine is destroyed, Sonic and Tails return the Master Emerald, and the Floating Island becomes airborne once again. If the player didn't collect all the Super Emeralds, a scene occurs which shows an Egg Robo emerging from a pile of metal.

          "description": "Sonic and Knuckles continues the story directly from where Sonic the Hedgehog 3 left off.  The explosion from the Death Egg sends Sonic flying deep into Floating Island's Mushroom Hills.  Sonic knows of the Master Emerald hidden somewhere on Floating Island, and is sure that Dr. Robotnik wants it to give his Death Egg limitless power.  Knuckles probably knows where it is - but can Sonic stop Robotnik's plans and find the Master Emerald all while fighting off Knuckles?  Meanwhile, Knuckles is guarding Floating Island when he's attacked by one of Robotnik's robots!  He quickly begins a chase for revenge.\n\nSonic & Knuckles is the fourth game in the Sonic series.  It retains the same basic features as in the previous Sonic games (speed, rings for protection, Special Stages with Chaos Emeralds) as well as the three different shield types introduced in Sonic 3 (Fire, Water and Electric).  Players can select either of the two title characters for play - either Sonic, or the all-new Knuckles the Echidna.  Knuckles cannot jump as high as Sonic, but he can glide by holding the jump button while in the air.  If you glide into a wall, Knuckles will also be able to climb it.  He can also break through walls that Sonic can't.  With these abilities, Knuckles can access different areas from Sonic, making for each level an entirely new experience.\n\nUnlike Sonic 3, Sonic & Knuckles features three bonus stages - two are available by jumping into the lamppost checkpoint stars (as in Sonic the Hedgehog 2.  These stages give you the chance to earn bonus rings, lives and power-ups.  The first is a Casino-themed level where you can jump into a slot machine and earn (or lose!) rings.  The second is a more skill-based level where you must time your jumps off orbs to launch higher and collect bonuses.  If you hit the barrier at the bottom of the stage, it ends.  The other type of bonus stage is the \"Special Stage\" seen in Sonic 3, which, as previously, can be accessed by jumping into giant rings hidden within the levels themselves.  If the player collects all the blue spheres in these stages (while avoiding all the red ones) they will earn a Chaos Emerald.\n\nA unique feature of the Sonic & Knuckles cart is the ability to \"Lock-On\" previous Sonic games into a cartridge slot at the top.  Adding Sonic 3 will combine both Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles into one long game, as well as adding the ability to save, and use Tails in the Sonic & Knuckles levels.  Plugging in Sonic 2 lets players use Knuckles in Sonic 2, as well allowing the use of his glide and wall climb abilities.  Finally, plugging in the original Sonic the Hedgehog cart lets the player access unlimited level variations of the Blue Sphere bonus stage.  Subsequent re-releases of Sonic & Knuckles have also included most of these bonus features.",

          "description": "The evil Dr. Robotnik wants to conquer the world. In order to do that, he imprisons and transforms all animals into robots called 'Badniks'. This way they can build his powerful weapon, the Death Egg.  Only Sonic the Hedgehog, and his new tagalong partner, Miles 'Tails' Prower, can stop Robotnik and his army of Badniks from taking over the world. \n\nSonic the Hedgehog 2 is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed, and the sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog.  Like the original, players run through different worlds called \"Zones\", which each have their own specific theme.  There are two Acts in nearly all of the 10 Zones, and at the end of each Zone's last Act is a machine that Robotnik controls, which you must defeat to progress.\n\nSonic and Tails can collect rings which are scattered throughout all of the levels.  As with most platformers, when the player collects 100 rings, they earn an extra life.  However, the rings also act as protection - if Sonic is hurt when he is carrying rings, they scatter everywhere and he is briefly invincible.  If he is hit again when he has no rings, he'll lose a life.\n\nIf the player reaches a continue point lamppost with 50 or more rings, they'll be able to access the Special Stage.  In this stage, you must gather a set amount of rings in a halfpipe-like stage before you reach a checkpoint.  Complete all the checkpoints and you'll earn one of the seven Chaos Emeralds.\n\nNew to Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is the ability to play the game co-op with a friend - at any time, a player can plug in a second controller and take over the AI controlled Tails.  Tails has infinite lives and the camera remains focused on Sonic, meaning that Tails will not hinder play.  Sonic (and Tails) can now also get speed from a standing start by holding down and repeatedly pressing the jump button for a \"Spin Dash\".  This is useful when stuck near steep slopes or other areas where you need some momentum.\n\nThe game also features a 2-player versus mode.  This mode is a horizontally split-screen race through levels based on three of the zones in the single player game.",

          "description": "Dr. Robotnik's Death Egg has crash-landed on Floating Island, so called because it harnesses the power of the Chaos Emeralds to float in the air.  Robotnik needs them to repair the Death Egg, so he tells the guardian of Floating Island, Knuckles the Echidna, that Sonic and Tails are there to steal them. With Knuckles tricked and trying to stop the heroes at every turn, will they be able to stop Robotnik in time?\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 3 is the third in the Sonic series of games.  As with the previous games, it is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed.  The basic game remains the same - players collect rings to earn extra lives, which are also used for protection, and scatter everywhere when Sonic is hurt.  Sonic can jump on enemies to defeat them, and Spin Dash by holding down and the jump button, then letting go of down.\n\nNew to Sonic 3 are three different types of shields - the Fire Shield (which protects you from fire but disappears if you enter water), the Water Shield (which lets you breathe underwater infinitely) and the Electric Shield (which pulls nearby rings towards you).  Sonic can use extra abilities when he has these shields by pressing jump while in the air - either a horizontal fireball dash, a vertical bubble bounce, or an electric double jump.  If Sonic has no shield active, he can activate a brief energy shield, also by pressing jump in the air.  Tails cannot use the shields' special abilities, but he can instead either fly or dog paddle (in water) for a limited time.  He can also carry Sonic with him while doing so.\n\nThere are now two types of bonus stages - one is available by collecting 50 or more rings, running past a checkpoint lamppost and then jumping into the stars (as you could in Sonic the Hedgehog 2.  This stage give you the chance to earn bonus rings, lives and power-ups.  In this stage, there is a giant gumball machine.  By hitting the crank, you'll spit out a bonus item that can either be rings, lives or bonus shields.  The stage is over when you fall down the bottom of the screen.\n\nThe other, more important, Special Stage can be accessed by jumping into giant rings that are hidden away in secret areas in each level.  In these stages, you must collect all the blue spheres while avoiding the red ones (which end the stage early).  Collecting all of the outer blue spheres around square or rectangle sphere formations will turn them all into rings - if you collect 50 or more in this stage, you can earn a continue.  Once you collect all the blue spheres in the stage, it clears and you earn one of the seven Chaos Emeralds.\n\nSonic 3 features six different Zones, which are made up of two Acts.  At the end of each Act is a boss that must be defeated to complete the stage and rescue Sonic's animal friends that Robotnik has captured to turn into Badnik robots.  The zones in Sonic 3 are approximately three times bigger than those in Sonic 2, and feature multiple, branching paths.\n\nAs with Sonic 2, there is a two-player Vs. Mode, which plays in a split-screen horizontal style.  There are special monitor pick-ups in this mode which do things like swap player positions, lose rings, or cause a Badnik to appear.  You can also race against the clock in a time trial mode.",

Each dino has its own strengths and weaknesses. You guide the dinosaur of your choice through the platform levels of the game. You are equipped with a gun: tons of enemies will attack you from all the sides, so your best bet will be walking with the fire button pressed down. You can shoot to all the directions and also engage in melee combat when the enemy is too close. Each level has a boss enemy waiting for you in the end. There is also a cooperative two-player mode.",

Using a mastery of genetic engineering and a tremendous reserve of wealth, Dr. Goldfire intends to unleash a mutant army upon the Earth.The first chapter begins in Goldfire's S.T.A.R. Institute headquarters building. Each level has Blake fighting through guards to find an elevator keycard for the next level. Dr. Goldfire will personally appear along the way to fire shots at Blake, and his genetic creations also pose a tough challenge. Each chapter lasts 10 levels, and brings Blake closer to reaching Goldfire, only to have the mad doctor escape to a new installation in his network, and the start of a new chapter.Blake Stone uses the Wolfenstein 3-D engine to render its levels. Basic gameplay and enemy AI is similar in most respects. Some of Blake 's innovations include silent weapons that can kill guards without alerting others. Alerts are given to the player through text messages on the HUD. Health can be gained through use of wall-mounted vending machines, operated with tokens picked up off dead guards. An automap and stat-tracking are both available during gameplay. Finally, there are friendly AI characters who offer clues and powerups when you speak to them - provided Blake doesn't accidentally shoot them first!",

Unfortunately, the mining robots are now being controlled by a hacker, and have taken the human workers hostage. The PTMC has tried to get the robots back under their control, but communication with the mining stations has been lost. In desperation, the PTMC modifies a Pyro-GX ship for combat and hires a mercenary, codenamed \"Material Defender\", to fly it. The mission is to destroy the infected mines and rescue human hostages, destroying any hostile robot that gets in the way.Descent is a 3D first-person game that puts the player at the controls of the Pyro-GX spaceship. Descent is notable in that the player travels through various interior locations (mines) but can do so in 720 degrees of movement. The ship however only moves forward and backward in any of the directions it is facing. The ship is able to use a variety of weapons scattered as power-ups throughout each level. They include: standard lasers, the Vulcan Cannon (a chaingun-like weapon), the Spreadfire Cannon (a rapidly firing, shotgun-like energy weapon), the Plasma Cannon (a rapidly firing energy weapon more suited for medium-range combat), and the Fusion Cannon (fires a ball of energy that's more powerful the longer it is charged it up, but could destroy the ship). All of these weapons, except for the Vulcan Cannon, use the ship's energy supply. The Pyro-PX is also capable of firing regular concussion missiles, homing missiles, proximity bombs (positioned midair, then explodes when something gets close to it), smart missiles (more powerful homing missiles that fire out homing energy balls upon impact with their target), and Mega Missiles (the ultimate weapons of mass destruction).The goal of each level is to locate and destroy the mine's reactor. Once completed, there is a countdown to find the escape hatch to get out of the mine before it explodes. As progress is made through the game, the AI will adapt to player's strategies and attempt to prevent the player from reaching the goals.",

After the initial entries of side-scrolling platform games, Duke Nukem 3D introduces a first-person perspective to the series and turns the game into a full-fledged shooter with 2.5D graphics.Duke's arsenal includes pistols, pipe bombs, laser trip mines, Nordenfelt guns, a chain gun and various rocket launchers, but also his mighty foot to kick enemies. The game sports a high level of interactivity. Many objects in the environment can be broken or interacted with, such as pool tables, arcade machines, glass, light switches and security cameras. The protagonist is also able to hand strippers dollars to have them remove their top.The main character regularly delivers commentary on the events through one-liners. There are twenty-eight levels, divided over three episodes, set in locations such as streets, a church, a space station, a Japanese villa, a football field and many modern environments. Enemies mainly include aliens, mutated humans and members of the police force that have been turned into Pig Cops. Next to weapons, Duke also has access to medikits, steroids to enhance his speed, night vision, protective boots, a hologram known as the \"holoduke\", and a jetpack to reach higher areas. Most of the gameplay is action-oriented, but there is also an amount of puzzles needed to progress or access secret areas.The game includes network play through the IPX protocol, for deathmatch and cooperative games.While the port for the Sega Saturn features, among other things, a new secret level called Area 51, the Sony PlayStation version adds a whole new 7 level long episode called Plug 'N' Pray with new enemies and rearranged music.",

There are 20 consecutive single-player levels and 12 multiplayer deathmatch levels.Unknown alien forces have invaded the city of Karnak, and isolated it from the rest of the world. The inhabitants were subjected to torture, or injected with a substance, turning them into servient mummies. Even the mummy of king Ramses was not spared. After multiple failed attempts from world leaders to send armed forces to deal with the situation, you were chosen among a select few of the world's best special forces to infiltrate Karnak and destroy the invading forces from within. The mission turns awry, however, when your helicopter is shot down, and you find yourself alone, hoping to complete your mission and get out of the fray alive.Contrary to the later console adaptations of the game, each of the 20 singleplayer levels are played back to back with the player hunting for keys and secret areas to proceed onto the next level, similar to other games of the time, such as DOOM. The game features a single save slot for each playthrough and has a checkpoint system, allowing the player to continue from the latest checkpoint they have found. Levels range from ancient cities and temples through sprawling caverns of also lava variety all the way to the alien Kilmaat ships, and are filled with traps and keys hiding multiple pathways from initial access.The player starts their adventure with a mere Machete, but can find weapons such as a Revolver, M60, hand grenades and a Flamethrower to magical weapons such as the Cobra Staff that fires seeking snake projectiles, and the Eye of Ra gauntlet which summons Ra to strike enemies down with lightning. Basic enemies include mummies and men-turned-zombies representing ancient gods; Anubis, Bastet and Set. Mystical being such as the Am-Mit, Selkis and a lava beast called Magmantis are also included. The alien Kilmaat forces are represented by Kilmaat soldiers and Kilmaatikhan. Crazed wildlife is represented by Rats, Giant Piranhas, Terranian spiders and Omen Wasps.Although the multiplayer in the game is set up to be deathmatch-only, it's possible to play the singleplayer levels with enemies.",

His way to the throne lies through the Sultan's lovely daughter. Jaffar kidnaps her and threatens to kill her if she refuses to marry him. Meanwhile, the man the Princess loves is thrown into the dungeon. He has only one hour to escape from his prison, defeat the guards on his way, and stop Jaffar before the terrible marriage takes place.Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer that is commonly regarded as a progenitor of the cinematic platformer genre. Rather than following the more common jump-and-run mechanics, it focuses on careful advancement through fairly complex levels, emphasizing the protagonist's vulnerability and survival aspect. Rotoscoping technique is used to give more realism to the animation of the characters' movements.The protagonist must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple jumping and environmental puzzles (such as stepping on pressure plates to raise portcullis), and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player character has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. The hero starts with three units of health, which can be replenished with small health potions or permanently increased with large jars.The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro, an altered set of graphics and four new levels.",

After having stolen the Death Star plans from a remote facility, he is tasked with investigating the sudden destruction of a hidden Rebel base. This leads him to face off against Imperial General Rom Mohc and the various iterations of his Dark Troopers - cybernetic soldiers with the armor and firepower to turn the tide of the war.Dark Forces is a close prequel to the original Star Wars movie trilogy. The game marks LucasArts' first attempt to enter the first-person shooter market. Instead of licensing the DOOM engine, like many competitors, LucasArts created its own internal Jedi engine. The Jedi engine contains advanced features over similar tech, including the ability to look up and down, jump, crouch, and limited support (in the build used for Dark Forces) for rooms (sectors) over rooms. The 3D models also make occasional appearances inside the game, as turrets or Kyle's ship dropping him off or picking him up from each mission.Most levels have a fairly complex, often maze-like structure, and include various switches that need to be activated to change the layout of the level. Jumping is integrated into the gameplay, as certain areas can only be accessed in that way. In addition to weapons, Kyle can use shields to protect himself from damage, a head lamp to illuminate dark areas, as well as specific items used to counter environmental hazards. The player character is given a certain amount of \"lives\" per level; he dies permanently once he runs out of all of them. Game progress can be saved only between missions.The game features fourteen substantial levels as Kyle works to disarm the Dark Trooper project. Many levels reference characters or areas from the Star Wars movie trilogy, such as a visit with Jabba the Hutt, a trip to Coruscant, and a battle through the interior of a Star Destroyer. As opposed to most first-person shooters of the time period, every level has objectives for Kyle to complete, ranging from grabbing a clue and getting out alive, to planting charges around a facility to demolish it. Cutscenes appear between key missions to update the plot.The Star Wars license gets plenty of use, as the game features imperial officers, stormtroopers, and a collection of aliens seen in the films as enemies. Blaster rifles and thermal detonators are used as weapons, along with other firearms inspired by the tech of the films. Dark Forces also uses the iMuse engine to dynamically change the music during action scenes, with much of the music based off or directly replicating, John Williams' original film score.The game is entirely a single-player campaign; no multiplayer is included or supported.",

It also adds another option called \"Timed Battle\".Tyrian is nothing like your run-of-the-mill shoot-'em-up. It gained a following even larger than the classic Raptor: Call of the Shadows, and rightfully so: it has a plot. A plot, you ask? Yes. And even a complex one. You play the role of Trent Hawkings, this galaxy's ace solo fighter-pilot, whose luck forces him to save the galaxy, one time after another. Again and again, Trent must fight off MicroSol, a company with the evil intent of taking over the galaxy. Through your struggles, you will find yourself again and again betrayed by friends and allies, your parents will be killed and you will have to return to points you've already been to (with variations on the levels) in order to remove further threats to the galaxy and to yourself, all for the ultimate goal of overthrowing MicroSol.Tyrian also has two player arcade mode and supports network/modem/serial play. It features a multi-layered ship upgrade engine, in which you can change hulls, decide upon and upgrade your front and rear weapons, buy better shields and generators and even add ship \"sidekicks\".

          "description": "Wolfenstein 3D is an episodic first-person shooter and a follow-up to the top-down infiltration game Castle Wolfenstein. The game puts the player in the boots of B.J. Blazkowicz, an allied spy. There are six episodes: the first distributed completely as shareware; the second and the third available after registration; and the three final missions (which happen before the events of the first episode) available in the Nocturnal Missions pack.In the first episode (Escape from Wolfenstein), B.J. is captured, but overpowers a guard with the help of a concealed knife and manages to get out of his cell. Throughout the next nine levels, the player guides B.J. searching for an escape from Wolfenstein, guarded by Hans Grosse. After returning to Allied territory, B.J. is given the instructions to Operation: Eisenfaust, where he has to stop Dr. Schabbs and his army of mutant prototypes before they are released into the battlefields. The final mission (Die, Führer, Die!) has a simple goal: infiltrate the bunker under the Reichstag, and terminate Hitler (in a robotic suit) himself.The Nocturnal Missions are focused on the Nazi plans for chemical warfare, and start with Dark Secret, where B.J. hunts for lead researcher Dr. Otto Giftmacher. It's followed by Trail of the Madman, where the goal is capturing the war plans guarded by Gretel Grosse, and the final episode Confrontation, where B.J. meets General Fettgesicht, the planner for the chemical assault.Each episode has nine levels (eight regular and a final boss level), plus a secret level activated by a hidden switch somewhere in the eight first levels. Regular levels often feature a maze-like appearance or large areas with many enemies (the number of them on each area depends on the difficulty level), where the player must reach the exit elevator. To do so, he must kill the enemies (while it's possible to move behind the guards' backs and even there's a slight bonus in attacking them from behind, most enemies have to be dealt with by firepower), and depending on the level, activate \"push walls\" and/or get silver and golden keys to open certain doors.Many objects can be found in a level, from medikits, chicken meals, and even dog food (to restore health), ammo, and treasures, which solely exist for points. There are four weapons (knife, pistol, machine gun, and Gatling), all of them using the same bullets except the knife. The knife and the pistol are given at the start of the level, while the machine gun is either found (usually in secret areas) or picked up from SS troopers, and the Gatling is always dropped somewhere in the level. There are five kinds of enemies (excluding bosses) - Dogs (fast, but more a nuisance than life-threatening), Army Soldiers (dressed in a regular brown outfit, not very powerful but usually found in large groups), Officers (dressed in white, armed with a very accurate pistol and tough to kill), SS Troopers (blue attire, armed with a machine gun and tough to kill), and Mutants (the rarest and toughest of regular enemies, pale-skinned troopers with green clothes and a machine gun stuck in their chest).The player character has a number of lives; once he loses the last life, the game ends. To win extra lives, the player has to either find the 1-up item in the level or get 20,000 points (by killing enemies and capturing treasures or completing a level below the 'par' time while killing all enemies, finding all secrets by pushing walls, and collecting all treasure points).",

Agent 007 and his friend Alec Trevalyan (a.k.a. Agent 006) were sent to Soviet Union on a secret mission. But everything goes wrong, James Bond barely escapes, and his friend is presumed dead.\n\nTen years later, a mysterious organization named \"Janus\" appeared. Commanding a new satellite called \"GoldenEye\", the organizations attempts to steal money electronically from banks, deleting all evidence of transfer. It's up to our Agent 007 to venture to Soviet Union once again, and to put an end to Janus' ambitions.\n\nIn this 3D action game, you control James Bond from a first-person perspective, using a variety of weapons (from knuckles to grenade launcher) to eliminate your foes. However, many parts require you to be careful, to stay unnoticed or to snipe guards from distance, since they will react to your presence and alarm their comrades. The game is divided into missions, and in some of them you'll have to perform other tasks besides killing your enemies: disarm bombs, take pictures of important evidence, or avoid killing scientists. The game features a multiplayer mode with a variety of options, and three difficulty levels.",

          "description": "Every game in the main series has a standard Party Mode in which up to four players play through a board, trying to collect as many stars as possible. In every turn, each player rolls a die and progresses on the board, which usually has branching paths. Coins are primarily earned by performing well in a minigame played at the end of each turn. On most boards, players earn stars by reaching a star space and purchasing a star for a certain amount of coins. The star space appears randomly on one of several pre-determined locations and moves every time a star is purchased, usually occupying a blue space.\nEvery Mario Party contains at least 50 to almost 110 minigames with a few different types. Four-player games are a free-for-all in which players compete individually. In 2-on-2 and 1-on-3 minigames, players compete as two groups, cooperating to win, even though they are still competing individually in the main game. Some minigames in Mario Party are 4-player co-op, even though it doesn't say it. In most situations, winners earn ten coins each.",
